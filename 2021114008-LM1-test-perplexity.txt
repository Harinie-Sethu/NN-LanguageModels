Perplexity: 629395904.0000

Sentence: “you have no enemy here—there is no one but fernand, my brother, who will grasp your hand as a devoted friend.” and at these words the young girl fixed her imperious look on the catalan, who, as if fascinated by it, came slowly towards edmond, and offered him his hand.

Perplexity: 244164000.0000

Sentence: “good-day,” said he.
Perplexity: 127675792.0000

Perplexity: 32844500.0000

Sentence: “well, fernand, i must say,” said caderousse, beginning the conversation, with that brutality of the common people in which curiosity destroys all diplomacy, “you look uncommonly like a rejected lover;” and he burst into a hoarse laugh.

Perplexity: 130935344.0000

Perplexity: 984354432.0000

Perplexity: 446419232.0000

Sentence: “never mind—in the meantime he marries mercédès—the lovely mercédès—at least he returns to do that.” during this time danglars fixed his piercing glance on the young man, on whose heart caderousse’s words fell like molten lead.

Perplexity: 135790976.0000

Sentence: “no, but it will be,” said caderousse, “as surely as dantès will be captain of the _pharaon_—eh, danglars?” danglars shuddered at this unexpected attack, and turned to caderousse, whose countenance he scrutinized, to try and detect whether the blow was premeditated; but he read nothing but envy in a countenance already rendered brutal and stupid by drunkenness.
Perplexity: 44197696.0000

Sentence: “well,” said he, filling the glasses, “let us drink to captain edmond dantès, husband of the beautiful catalane!” caderousse raised his glass to his mouth with unsteady hand, and swallowed the contents at a gulp.

Perplexity: 644050048.0000

Sentence: come this way, and let us know when the wedding is to be, for fernand here is so obstinate he will not tell us.” “hold your tongue, will you?” said danglars, pretending to restrain caderousse, who, with the tenacity of drunkards, leaned out of the arbor.

Sentence: “try to stand upright, and let the lovers make love without interruption.
Perplexity: 152309168.0000

Sentence: see, look at fernand, and follow his example; he is well-behaved!” 0051m fernand, probably excited beyond bearing, pricked by danglars, as the bull is by the bandilleros, was about to rush out; for he had risen from his seat, and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong upon his rival, when mercédès, smiling and graceful, lifted up her lovely head, and looked at them with her clear and bright eyes.

Perplexity: 650670720.0000

Sentence: “hallo!” continued caderousse, half-rising, and with his fist on the table, “hallo, edmond!
Perplexity: 415105664.0000

Sentence: do you not see your friends, or are you too proud to speak to them?” “no, my dear fellow!” replied dantès, “i am not proud, but i am happy, and happiness blinds, i think, more than pride.” “ah, very well, that’s an explanation!” said caderousse.
Perplexity: 174659968.0000

Sentence: so call me mercédès, if you please.” “we must excuse our worthy neighbor, caderousse,” said dantès, “he is so easily mistaken.” “so, then, the wedding is to take place immediately, m. dantès,” said danglars, bowing to the young couple.

Perplexity: 1434247552.0000

Sentence: women say those things, but never do them.” “you do not know mercédès; what she threatens she will do.” “idiot!” muttered danglars; “whether she kill herself or not, what matter, provided dantès is not captain?” “before mercédès should die,” replied fernand, with the accents of unshaken resolution, “i would die myself!” “that’s what i call love!” said caderousse with a voice more tipsy than ever.

Perplexity: 1078455552.0000

Sentence: mercédès, who will detest you if you have only the misfortune to scratch the skin of her dearly beloved edmond!” “true!” said fernand.
Perplexity: 95319920.0000

Sentence: “no, no,” continued danglars; “if we resolve on such a step, it would be much better to take, as i now do, this pen, dip it into this ink, and write with the left hand (that the writing may not be recognized) the denunciation we propose.” and danglars, uniting practice with theory, wrote with his left hand, and in a writing reversed from his usual style, and totally unlike it, the following lines, which he handed to fernand, and which fernand read in an undertone: “the honorable, the king’s attorney, is informed by a friend of the throne and religion, that one edmond dantès, mate of the ship _pharaon_, arrived this morning from smyrna, after having touched at naples and porto-ferrajo, has been intrusted by murat with a letter for the usurper, and by the usurper with a letter for the bonapartist committee in paris.
Perplexity: 262590032.0000

Sentence: proof of this crime will be found on arresting him, for the letter will be found upon him, or at his father’s, or in his cabin on board the _pharaon_.” “very good,” resumed danglars; “now your revenge looks like common sense, for in no way can it revert to yourself, and the matter will thus work its own way; there is nothing to do now but fold the letter as i am doing, and write upon it, ‘to the king’s attorney,’ and that’s all settled.” and danglars wrote the address as he spoke.
Perplexity: 92276808.0000

Sentence: “yes, and that’s all settled!” exclaimed caderousse, who, by a last effort of intellect, had followed the reading of the letter, and instinctively comprehended all the misery which such a denunciation must entail.
Perplexity: 137654992.0000

Sentence: “yes, and that’s all settled; only it will be an infamous shame;” and he stretched out his hand to reach the letter.
Perplexity: 43594216.0000

Sentence: “yes,” said danglars, taking it from beyond his reach; “and as what i say and do is merely in jest, and i, amongst the first and foremost, should be sorry if anything happened to dantès—the worthy dantès—look here!” and taking the letter, he squeezed it up in his hands and threw it into a corner of the arbor.
Perplexity: 1895942272.0000

Sentence: “all right!” said caderousse.
Perplexity: 2439555840.0000

Sentence: “dantès is my friend, and i won’t have him ill-used.” “and who thinks of using him ill?
Perplexity: 570048512.0000

Sentence: certainly neither i nor fernand,” said danglars, rising and looking at the young man, who still remained seated, but whose eye was fixed on the denunciatory sheet of paper flung into the corner.
Perplexity: 300507904.0000

Sentence: “in this case,” replied caderousse, “let’s have some more wine.
Perplexity: 2550724352.0000

Sentence: i wish to drink to the health of edmond and the lovely mercédès.” “you have had too much already, drunkard,” said danglars; “and if you continue, you will be compelled to sleep here, because unable to stand on your legs.” “i?” said caderousse, rising with all the offended dignity of a drunken man, “i can’t keep on my legs?
Perplexity: 268584512.0000

Sentence: why, i’ll wager i can go up into the belfry of the accoules, and without staggering, too!” “done!” said danglars, “i’ll take your bet; but tomorrow—today it is time to return.
Perplexity: 432872544.0000

Perplexity: 1301351936.0000

Sentence: come along, danglars, and let the young gentleman return to the catalans if he chooses.” danglars took advantage of caderousse’s temper at the moment, to take him off towards marseilles by the porte saint-victor, staggering as he went.
Perplexity: 156754816.0000

Sentence: when they had advanced about twenty yards, danglars looked back and saw fernand stoop, pick up the crumpled paper, and putting it into his pocket then rush out of the arbor towards pillon.

Perplexity: 1455958528.0000

Sentence: the apartment destined for the purpose was spacious and lighted by a number of windows, over each of which was written in golden letters for some inexplicable reason the name of one of the principal cities of france; beneath these windows a wooden balcony extended the entire length of the house.
Perplexity: 221095984.0000

Sentence: and although the entertainment was fixed for twelve o’clock, an hour previous to that time the balcony was filled with impatient and expectant guests, consisting of the favored part of the crew of the _pharaon_, and other personal friends of the bridegroom, the whole of whom had arrayed themselves in their choicest costumes, in order to do greater honor to the occasion.
Perplexity: 193571552.0000

Sentence: various rumors were afloat to the effect that the owners of the _pharaon_ had promised to attend the nuptial feast; but all seemed unanimous in doubting that an act of such rare and exceeding condescension could possibly be intended.
Perplexity: 69014656.0000

Sentence: danglars, however, who now made his appearance, accompanied by caderousse, effectually confirmed the report, stating that he had recently conversed with m. morrel, who had himself assured him of his intention to dine at la réserve.
Perplexity: 345812576.0000

Sentence: in fact, a moment later m. morrel appeared and was saluted with an enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the _pharaon_, who hailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man whose wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first in command of the ship; and as dantès was universally beloved on board his vessel, the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at finding that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly coincided with their own.
Perplexity: 24488866.0000

Sentence: with the entrance of m. morrel, danglars and caderousse were despatched in search of the bridegroom to convey to him the intelligence of the arrival of the important personage whose coming had created such a lively sensation, and to beseech him to make haste.
Perplexity: 40388640.0000

Sentence: danglars and caderousse set off upon their errand at full speed; but ere they had gone many steps they perceived a group advancing towards them, composed of the betrothed pair, a party of young girls in attendance on the bride, by whose side walked dantès’ father; the whole brought up by fernand, whose lips wore their usual sinister smile.
Perplexity: 471377760.0000

Sentence: neither mercédès nor edmond observed the strange expression of his countenance; they were so happy that they were conscious only of the sunshine and the presence of each other.

Perplexity: 28666666.0000

Sentence: beside him glided caderousse, whose desire to partake of the good things provided for the wedding party had induced him to become reconciled to the dantès, father and son, although there still lingered in his mind a faint and unperfect recollection of the events of the preceding night; just as the brain retains on waking in the morning the dim and misty outline of a dream.
Perplexity: 5029828096.0000

Sentence: 0065m as danglars approached the disappointed lover, he cast on him a look of deep meaning, while fernand, as he slowly paced behind the happy pair, who seemed, in their own unmixed content, to have entirely forgotten that such a being as himself existed, was pale and abstracted; occasionally, however, a deep flush would overspread his countenance, and a nervous contraction distort his features, while, with an agitated and restless gaze, he would glance in the direction of marseilles, like one who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important event.
Perplexity: 191435728.0000

Sentence: dantès himself was simply, but becomingly, clad in the dress peculiar to the merchant service—a costume somewhat between a military and a civil garb; and with his fine countenance, radiant with joy and happiness, a more perfect specimen of manly beauty could scarcely be imagined.
Perplexity: 221537104.0000

Perplexity: 942844160.0000

Sentence: one more practiced in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes beneath a veil, or, at least, have cast down her thickly fringed lashes, so as to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes; but, on the contrary, the delighted girl looked around her with a smile that seemed to say: “if you are my friends, rejoice with me, for i am very happy.” as soon as the bridal party came in sight of la réserve, m. morrel descended and came forth to meet it, followed by the soldiers and sailors there assembled, to whom he had repeated the promise already given, that dantès should be the successor to the late captain leclere.
Perplexity: 41267484.0000

Sentence: edmond, at the approach of his patron, respectfully placed the arm of his affianced bride within that of m. morrel, who, forthwith conducting her up the flight of wooden steps leading to the chamber in which the feast was prepared, was gayly followed by the guests, beneath whose heavy tread the slight structure creaked and groaned for the space of several minutes.
Perplexity: 1323348864.0000

Sentence: “father,” said mercédès, stopping when she had reached the centre of the table, “sit, i pray you, on my right hand; on my left i will place him who has ever been as a brother to me,” pointing with a soft and gentle smile to fernand; but her words and look seemed to inflict the direst torture on him, for his lips became ghastly pale, and even beneath the dark hue of his complexion the blood might be seen retreating as though some sudden pang drove it back to the heart.
Perplexity: 330006880.0000

Perplexity: 144935808.0000

Sentence: then they began to pass around the dusky, piquant, arlesian sausages, and lobsters in their dazzling red cuirasses, prawns of large size and brilliant color, the echinus with its prickly outside and dainty morsel within, the clovis, esteemed by the epicures of the south as more than rivalling the exquisite flavor of the oyster, north.
Perplexity: 651880640.0000

Sentence: all the delicacies, in fact, that are cast up by the wash of waters on the sandy beach, and styled by the grateful fishermen “fruits of the sea.” “a pretty silence truly!” said the old father of the bridegroom, as he carried to his lips a glass of wine of the hue and brightness of the topaz, and which had just been placed before mercédès herself.
Perplexity: 228911936.0000

Sentence: “now, would anybody think that this room contained a happy, merry party, who desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away?” “ah,” sighed caderousse, “a man cannot always feel happy because he is about to be married.” “the truth is,” replied dantès, “that i am too happy for noisy mirth; if that is what you meant by your observation, my worthy friend, you are right; joy takes a strange effect at times, it seems to oppress us almost the same as sorrow.” danglars looked towards fernand, whose excitable nature received and betrayed each fresh impression.

Sentence: “why, what ails you?” asked he of edmond.

Perplexity: 2511873536.0000

Perplexity: 179541792.0000

Sentence: i own that i am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of which i feel myself unworthy—that of being the husband of mercédès.” “nay, nay!” cried caderousse, smiling, “you have not attained that honor yet.
Perplexity: 204855904.0000

Sentence: mercédès is not yet your wife.
Perplexity: 697584640.0000

Sentence: just assume the tone and manner of a husband, and see how she will remind you that your hour is not yet come!” the bride blushed, while fernand, restless and uneasy, seemed to start at every fresh sound, and from time to time wiped away the large drops of perspiration that gathered on his brow.
Perplexity: 484619552.0000

Sentence: “well, never mind that, neighbor caderousse; it is not worthwhile to contradict me for such a trifle as that.
Perplexity: 49767644.0000

Sentence: ’tis true that mercédès is not actually my wife; but,” added he, drawing out his watch, “in an hour and a half she will be.” a general exclamation of surprise ran round the table, with the exception of the elder dantès, whose laugh displayed the still perfect beauty of his large white teeth.

Perplexity: 19840464.0000

Sentence: now, as a quarter-past one has already struck, i do not consider i have asserted too much in saying, that, in another hour and thirty minutes mercédès will have become madame dantès.” 0069m fernand closed his eyes, a burning sensation passed across his brow, and he was compelled to support himself by the table to prevent his falling from his chair; but in spite of all his efforts, he could not refrain from uttering a deep groan, which, however, was lost amid the noisy felicitations of the company.
Perplexity: 494344672.0000

Perplexity: 1434896000.0000

Perplexity: 23106744.0000

Sentence: tomorrow morning i start for paris; four days to go, and the same to return, with one day to discharge the commission entrusted to me, is all the time i shall be absent.
Perplexity: 152236272.0000

Sentence: i shall be back here by the first of march, and on the second i give my real marriage feast.” this prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the guests to such a degree, that the elder dantès, who, at the commencement of the repast, had commented upon the silence that prevailed, now found it difficult, amid the general din of voices, to obtain a moment’s tranquillity in which to drink to the health and prosperity of the bride and bridegroom.
Perplexity: 26498126.0000

Perplexity: 1180396544.0000

Perplexity: 513883200.0000

Sentence: caderousse approached him just as danglars, whom fernand seemed most anxious to avoid, had joined him in a corner of the room.
Perplexity: 706553728.0000

Sentence: “upon my word,” said caderousse, from whose mind the friendly treatment of dantès, united with the effect of the excellent wine he had partaken of, had effaced every feeling of envy or jealousy at dantès’ good fortune,—“upon my word, dantès is a downright good fellow, and when i see him sitting there beside his pretty wife that is so soon to be.
Perplexity: 635698560.0000

Sentence: i cannot help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him that trick you were planning yesterday.” “oh, there was no harm meant,” answered danglars; “at first i certainly did feel somewhat uneasy as to what fernand might be tempted to do; but when i saw how completely he had mastered his feelings, even so far as to become one of his rival’s attendants, i knew there was no further cause for apprehension.” caderousse looked full at fernand—he was ghastly pale.
Perplexity: 310972736.0000

Perplexity: 258702944.0000

Sentence: gad!
Perplexity: 2018997760.0000

Sentence: i only wish he would let me take his place.” “shall we not set forth?” asked the sweet, silvery voice of mercédès; “two o’clock has just struck, and you know we are expected in a quarter of an hour.” 0071m “to be sure!—to be sure!” cried dantès, eagerly quitting the table; “let us go directly!” his words were re-echoed by the whole party, with vociferous cheers.
Perplexity: 759008128.0000

Sentence: at this moment danglars, who had been incessantly observing every change in fernand’s look and manner, saw him stagger and fall back, with an almost convulsive spasm, against a seat placed near one of the open windows.
Perplexity: 5718947328.0000

Sentence: at the same instant his ear caught a sort of indistinct sound on the stairs, followed by the measured tread of soldiery, with the clanking of swords and military accoutrements; then came a hum and buzz as of many voices, so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the bridal party, among whom a vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension quelled every disposition to talk, and almost instantaneously the most deathlike stillness prevailed.

Perplexity: 57090564.0000

Perplexity: 1557909504.0000

Sentence: who among the persons here assembled answers to the name of edmond dantès?” every eye was turned towards the young man who, spite of the agitation he could not but feel, advanced with dignity, and said, in a firm voice: “i am he; what is your pleasure with me?” “edmond dantès,” replied the magistrate, “i arrest you in the name of the law!” “me!” repeated edmond, slightly changing color, “and wherefore, i pray?” “i cannot inform you, but you will be duly acquainted with the reasons that have rendered such a step necessary at the preliminary examination.” m. morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless.
Perplexity: 69516952.0000

Sentence: he saw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law, and perfectly well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate decked with his official scarf, as to address a petition to some cold marble effigy.

Sentence: your son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his cargo, and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given the information required, whether touching the health of his crew, or the value of his freight.” “what is the meaning of all this?” inquired caderousse, frowningly, of danglars, who had assumed an air of utter surprise.
Perplexity: 849719808.0000

Sentence: 0073m “how can i tell you?” replied he; “i am, like yourself, utterly bewildered at all that is going on, and cannot in the least make out what it is about.” caderousse then looked around for fernand, but he had disappeared.

Perplexity: 255537328.0000

Sentence: “what think you, danglars,” said one of the party, turning towards him, “of this event?” “why,” replied he, “i think it just possible dantès may have been detected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as contraband.” “but how could he have done so without your knowledge, danglars, since you are the ship’s supercargo?” “why, as for that, i could only know what i was told respecting the merchandise with which the vessel was laden.

Perplexity: 144533024.0000

Sentence: now, should any letters or other documents of a compromising character be found upon him, will it not be taken for granted that all who uphold him are his accomplices?” with the rapid instinct of selfishness, caderousse readily perceived the solidity of this mode of reasoning; he gazed, doubtfully, wistfully, on danglars, and then caution supplanted generosity.
Perplexity: 20165058.0000

Sentence: “suppose we wait a while, and see what comes of it,” said he, casting a bewildered look on his companion.

Perplexity: 1206019584.0000

Sentence: “you are a worthy fellow; and i had already thought of your interests in the event of poor edmond having become captain of the _pharaon_.” “is it possible you were so kind?” “yes, indeed; i had previously inquired of dantès what was his opinion of you, and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your post, for somehow i have perceived a sort of coolness between you.” “and what was his reply?” “that he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which he merely referred to without entering into particulars, but that whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ship’s owners would have his preference also.” “the hypocrite!” murmured danglars.

Perplexity: 269596128.0000

Sentence: “you know that i am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced captain in the service; and it will be so far advantageous to you to accept my services, that upon edmond’s release from prison no further change will be requisite on board the _pharaon_ than for dantès and myself each to resume our respective posts.” “thanks, danglars—that will smooth over all difficulties.
Perplexity: 36420720.0000

Sentence: i fully authorize you at once to assume the command of the _pharaon_, and look carefully to the unloading of her freight.

Perplexity: 139699856.0000

Sentence: i am aware he is a furious royalist; but, in spite of that, and of his being king’s attorney, he is a man like ourselves, and i fancy not a bad sort of one.” “perhaps not,” replied danglars; “but i hear that he is ambitious, and that’s rather against him.” “well, well,” returned m. morrel, “we shall see.
Perplexity: 121169328.0000

Perplexity: 139773680.0000

Perplexity: 455191936.0000

Sentence: neither you nor myself, but fernand; you knew very well that i threw the paper into a corner of the room—indeed, i fancied i had destroyed it.” “oh, no,” replied caderousse, “that i can answer for, you did not.
Perplexity: 133677072.0000

Sentence: i only wish i could see it now as plainly as i saw it lying all crushed and crumpled in a corner of the arbor.” “well, then, if you did, depend upon it, fernand picked it up, and either copied it or caused it to be copied; perhaps, even, he did not take the trouble of recopying it.
Perplexity: 9449460.0000

Sentence: and now i think of it, by heavens, he may have sent the letter itself!
Perplexity: 3467162368.0000

Sentence: as i before said, i thought the whole thing was a joke, nothing more.
Perplexity: 35519332.0000

Perplexity: 707706944.0000

Sentence: you will see, danglars, that it will turn out an unlucky job for both of us.” “nonsense!
Perplexity: 43487168.0000

Perplexity: 10474348544.0000

Sentence: all we have got to do is, to keep our own counsel, and remain perfectly quiet, not breathing a word to any living soul; and you will see that the storm will pass away without in the least affecting us.” “amen!” responded caderousse, waving his hand in token of adieu to danglars, and bending his steps towards the allées de meilhan, moving his head to and fro, and muttering as he went, after the manner of one whose mind was overcharged with one absorbing idea.
Perplexity: 290844800.0000

Sentence: “so far, then,” said danglars, mentally, “all has gone as i would have it.
Perplexity: 229892048.0000

Perplexity: 245559040.0000

Sentence: instead of a rude mixture of sailors, soldiers, and those belonging to the humblest grade of life, the present assembly was composed of the very flower of marseilles society,—magistrates who had resigned their office during the usurper’s reign; officers who had deserted from the imperial army and joined forces with condé; and younger members of families, brought up to hate and execrate the man whom five years of exile would convert into a martyr, and fifteen of restoration elevate to the rank of a god.
Perplexity: 3449366272.0000

Sentence: the guests were still at table, and the heated and energetic conversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions that then agitated each dweller of the south, where unhappily, for five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness to the violence of party feeling.
Perplexity: 476408704.0000

Sentence: the emperor, now king of the petty island of elba, after having held sovereign sway over one-half of the world, counting as his subjects a small population of five or six thousand souls,—after having been accustomed to hear the “_vive napoléons_” of a hundred and twenty millions of human beings, uttered in ten different languages,—was looked upon here as a ruined man, separated forever from any fresh connection with france or claim to her throne.

Perplexity: 110784776.0000

Sentence: i really must pray you to excuse me, but—in truth—i was not attending to the conversation.” “marquise, marquise!” interposed the old nobleman who had proposed the toast, “let the young people alone; let me tell you, on one’s wedding day there are more agreeable subjects of conversation than dry politics.” “never mind, dearest mother,” said a young and lovely girl, with a profusion of light brown hair, and eyes that seemed to float in liquid crystal, “’tis all my fault for seizing upon m. de villefort, so as to prevent his listening to what you said.
Perplexity: 181448656.0000

Perplexity: 430255776.0000

Perplexity: 688754304.0000

Sentence: “never mind, renée,” replied the marquise, with a look of tenderness that seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features; but, however all other feelings may be withered in a woman’s nature, there is always one bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart, and that is the shrine of maternal love.
Perplexity: 4564502016.0000

Sentence: “i forgive you.
Perplexity: 374732864.0000

Sentence: what i was saying, villefort, was, that the bonapartists had not our sincerity, enthusiasm, or devotion.” “they had, however, what supplied the place of those fine qualities,” replied the young man, “and that was fanaticism.
Perplexity: 1112018816.0000

Sentence: napoleon is the mahomet of the west, and is worshipped by his commonplace but ambitious followers, not only as a leader and lawgiver, but also as the personification of equality.” “he!” cried the marquise: “napoleon the type of equality!

Perplexity: 311376928.0000

Sentence: the only difference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated by these two men; one is the equality that elevates, the other is the equality that degrades; one brings a king within reach of the guillotine, the other elevates the people to a level with the throne.
Perplexity: 757788736.0000

Sentence: observe,” said villefort, smiling, “i do not mean to deny that both these men were revolutionary scoundrels, and that the 9th thermidor and the 4th of april, in the year 1814, were lucky days for france, worthy of being gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil order; and that explains how it comes to pass that, fallen, as i trust he is forever, napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical satellites.
Perplexity: 62096876.0000

Sentence: still, marquise, it has been so with other usurpers—cromwell, for instance, who was not half so bad as napoleon, had his partisans and advocates.” “do you know, villefort, that you are talking in a most dreadfully revolutionary strain?
Perplexity: 44162808.0000

Sentence: but i excuse it, it is impossible to expect the son of a girondin to be free from a small spice of the old leaven.” a deep crimson suffused the countenance of villefort.
Perplexity: 2510680832.0000

Sentence: “’tis true, madame,” answered he, “that my father was a girondin, but he was not among the number of those who voted for the king’s death; he was an equal sufferer with yourself during the reign of terror, and had well-nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father perished.” “true,” replied the marquise, without wincing in the slightest degree at the tragic remembrance thus called up; “but bear in mind, if you please, that our respective parents underwent persecution and proscription from diametrically opposite principles; in proof of which i may remark, that while my family remained among the staunchest adherents of the exiled princes, your father lost no time in joining the new government; and that while the citizen noirtier was a girondin, the count noirtier became a senator.” “dear mother,” interposed renée, “you know very well it was agreed that all these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside.” “suffer me, also, madame,” replied villefort, “to add my earnest request to mademoiselle de saint-méran’s, that you will kindly allow the veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past.

Perplexity: 66157660.0000

Sentence: let what may remain of revolutionary sap exhaust itself and die away with the old trunk, and condescend only to regard the young shoot which has started up at a distance from the parent tree, without having the power, any more than the wish, to separate entirely from the stock from which it sprung.” “bravo, villefort!” cried the marquis; “excellently well said!
Perplexity: 118286832.0000

Sentence: come, now, i have hopes of obtaining what i have been for years endeavoring to persuade the marquise to promise; namely, a perfect amnesty and forgetfulness of the past.” “with all my heart,” replied the marquise; “let the past be forever forgotten.
Perplexity: 84619840.0000

Sentence: i promise you it affords _me_ as little pleasure to revive it as it does you.
Perplexity: 141076992.0000

Sentence: all i ask is, that villefort will be firm and inflexible for the future in his political principles.
Perplexity: 154774992.0000

Sentence: remember, also, villefort, that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your fealty and strict loyalty, and that at our recommendation the king consented to forget the past, as i do” (and here she extended to him her hand)—“as i now do at your entreaty.
Perplexity: 108436840.0000

Sentence: but bear in mind, that should there fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the government, you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence with rigorous punishment, as it is known you belong to a suspected family.” “alas, madame,” returned villefort, “my profession, as well as the times in which we live, compels me to be severe.
Perplexity: 423126624.0000

Sentence: i have already successfully conducted several public prosecutions, and brought the offenders to merited punishment.
Perplexity: 51836996.0000

Sentence: “i am, at least, fearful of it.
Perplexity: 244226864.0000

Sentence: napoleon, in the island of elba, is too near france, and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans.
Perplexity: 443658784.0000

Sentence: marseilles is filled with half-pay officers, who are daily, under one frivolous pretext or other, getting up quarrels with the royalists; from hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of persons, and assassinations in the lower.” “you have heard, perhaps,” said the comte de salvieux, one of m. de saint-méran’s oldest friends, and chamberlain to the comte d’artois, “that the holy alliance purpose removing him from thence?” “yes; they were talking about it when we left paris,” said m. de saint-méran; “and where is it decided to transfer him?” “to saint helena.” “for heaven’s sake, where is that?” asked the marquise.

Perplexity: 176001984.0000

Sentence: as villefort observes, it is a great act of folly to have left such a man between corsica, where he was born, and naples, of which his brother-in-law is king, and face to face with italy, the sovereignty of which he coveted for his son.” “unfortunately,” said villefort, “there are the treaties of 1814, and we cannot molest napoleon without breaking those compacts.” “oh, well, we shall find some way out of it,” responded m. de salvieux.
Perplexity: 341628608.0000

Sentence: “there wasn’t any trouble over treaties when it was a question of shooting the poor duc d’enghien.” “well,” said the marquise, “it seems probable that, by the aid of the holy alliance, we shall be rid of napoleon; and we must trust to the vigilance of m. de villefort to purify marseilles of his partisans.
Perplexity: 330242368.0000

Sentence: the king is either a king or no king; if he be acknowledged as sovereign of france, he should be upheld in peace and tranquillity; and this can best be effected by employing the most inflexible agents to put down every attempt at conspiracy—’tis the best and surest means of preventing mischief.” “unfortunately, madame,” answered villefort, “the strong arm of the law is not called upon to interfere until the evil has taken place.” “then all he has got to do is to endeavor to repair it.” “nay, madame, the law is frequently powerless to effect this; all it can do is to avenge the wrong done.” “oh, m. de villefort,” cried a beautiful young creature, daughter to the comte de salvieux, and the cherished friend of mademoiselle de saint-méran, “do try and get up some famous trial while we are at marseilles.
Perplexity: 117596000.0000

Sentence: i never was in a law-court; i am told it is so very amusing!” “amusing, certainly,” replied the young man, “inasmuch as, instead of shedding tears as at the fictitious tale of woe produced at a theatre, you behold in a law-court a case of real and genuine distress—a drama of life.
Perplexity: 3099667968.0000

Sentence: the prisoner whom you there see pale, agitated, and alarmed, instead of—as is the case when a curtain falls on a tragedy—going home to sup peacefully with his family, and then retiring to rest, that he may recommence his mimic woes on the morrow,—is removed from your sight merely to be reconducted to his prison and delivered up to the executioner.
Perplexity: 373785600.0000

Sentence: i leave you to judge how far your nerves are calculated to bear you through such a scene.
Perplexity: 21481730.0000

Sentence: of this, however, be assured, that should any favorable opportunity present itself, i will not fail to offer you the choice of being present.” “for shame, m. de villefort!” said renée, becoming quite pale; “don’t you see how you are frightening us?—and yet you laugh.” “what would you have?
Perplexity: 172829376.0000

Sentence: ’tis like a duel.
Perplexity: 413274464.0000

Sentence: i have already recorded sentence of death, five or six times, against the movers of political conspiracies, and who can say how many daggers may be ready sharpened, and only waiting a favorable opportunity to be buried in my heart?” “gracious heavens, m. de villefort,” said renée, becoming more and more terrified; “you surely are not in earnest.” “indeed i am,” replied the young magistrate with a smile; “and in the interesting trial that young lady is anxious to witness, the case would only be still more aggravated.
Perplexity: 728692992.0000

Sentence: suppose, for instance, the prisoner, as is more than probable, to have served under napoleon—well, can you expect for an instant, that one accustomed, at the word of his commander, to rush fearlessly on the very bayonets of his foe, will scruple more to drive a stiletto into the heart of one he knows to be his personal enemy, than to slaughter his fellow-creatures, merely because bidden to do so by one he is bound to obey?
Perplexity: 41386192.0000

Sentence: besides, one requires the excitement of being hateful in the eyes of the accused, in order to lash one’s self into a state of sufficient vehemence and power.
Perplexity: 272944736.0000

Sentence: i would not choose to see the man against whom i pleaded smile, as though in mockery of my words.
Perplexity: 175960688.0000

Sentence: no; my pride is to see the accused pale, agitated, and as though beaten out of all composure by the fire of my eloquence.” renée uttered a smothered exclamation.
Perplexity: 1278062080.0000

Sentence: “bravo!” cried one of the guests; “that is what i call talking to some purpose.” “just the person we require at a time like the present,” said a second.
Perplexity: 70315744.0000

Sentence: “what a splendid business that last case of yours was, my dear villefort!” remarked a third; “i mean the trial of the man for murdering his father.
Perplexity: 994355776.0000

Sentence: upon my word, you killed him ere the executioner had laid his hand upon him.” “oh, as for parricides, and such dreadful people as that,” interposed renée, “it matters very little what is done to them; but as regards poor unfortunate creatures whose only crime consists in having mixed themselves up in political intrigues——” “why, that is the very worst offence they could possibly commit; for, don’t you see, renée, the king is the father of his people, and he who shall plot or contrive aught against the life and safety of the parent of thirty-two millions of souls, is a parricide upon a fearfully great scale?” “i don’t know anything about that,” replied renée; “but, m. de villefort, you have promised me—have you not?—always to show mercy to those i plead for.” “make yourself quite easy on that point,” answered villefort, with one of his sweetest smiles; “you and i will always consult upon our verdicts.” “my love,” said the marquise, “attend to your doves, your lap-dogs, and embroidery, but do not meddle with what you do not understand.
Perplexity: 15626427.0000

Sentence: nowadays the military profession is in abeyance and the magisterial robe is the badge of honor.
Perplexity: 736144448.0000

Sentence: there is a wise latin proverb that is very much in point.” “_cedant arma togæ_,” said villefort with a bow.
Perplexity: 724930688.0000

Sentence: “i cannot speak latin,” responded the marquise.
Perplexity: 116642144.0000

Sentence: “well,” said renée, “i cannot help regretting you had not chosen some other profession than your own—a physician, for instance.
Perplexity: 141660752.0000

Sentence: do you know i always felt a shudder at the idea of even a _destroying_ angel?” “dear, good renée,” whispered villefort, as he gazed with unutterable tenderness on the lovely speaker.
Perplexity: 649827328.0000

Sentence: “let us hope, my child,” cried the marquis, “that m. de villefort may prove the moral and political physician of this province; if so, he will have achieved a noble work.” “and one which will go far to efface the recollection of his father’s conduct,” added the incorrigible marquise.
Perplexity: 88924392.0000

Sentence: “madame,” replied villefort, with a mournful smile, “i have already had the honor to observe that my father has—at least, i hope so—abjured his past errors, and that he is, at the present moment, a firm and zealous friend to religion and order—a better royalist, possibly, than his son; for he has to atone for past dereliction, while i have no other impulse than warm, decided preference and conviction.” having made this well-turned speech, villefort looked carefully around to mark the effect of his oratory, much as he would have done had he been addressing the bench in open court.
Perplexity: 1799677056.0000

Sentence: “do you know, my dear villefort,” cried the comte de salvieux, “that is exactly what i myself said the other day at the tuileries, when questioned by his majesty’s principal chamberlain touching the singularity of an alliance between the son of a girondin and the daughter of an officer of the duc de condé; and i assure you he seemed fully to comprehend that this mode of reconciling political differences was based upon sound and excellent principles.
Perplexity: 177430432.0000

Sentence: then the king, who, without our suspecting it, had overheard our conversation, interrupted us by saying, ‘villefort’—observe that the king did not pronounce the word noirtier, but, on the contrary, placed considerable emphasis on that of villefort—‘villefort,’ said his majesty, ‘is a young man of great judgment and discretion, who will be sure to make a figure in his profession; i like him much, and it gave me great pleasure to hear that he was about to become the son-in-law of the marquis and marquise de saint-méran.
Perplexity: 147376656.0000

Sentence: i should myself have recommended the match, had not the noble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my consent to it.’” “is it possible the king could have condescended so far as to express himself so favorably of me?” asked the enraptured villefort.
Perplexity: 136733888.0000

Sentence: “i give you his very words; and if the marquis chooses to be candid, he will confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to him, when he went six months ago to consult him upon the subject of your espousing his daughter.” 0091m “that is true,” answered the marquis.
Perplexity: 1098753280.0000

Sentence: “how much do i owe this gracious prince!
Perplexity: 38075804.0000

Sentence: what is there i would not do to evince my earnest gratitude!” “that is right,” cried the marquise.
Perplexity: 48110944.0000

Sentence: “i love to see you thus.
Perplexity: 183275792.0000

Sentence: now, then, were a conspirator to fall into your hands, he would be most welcome.” “for my part, dear mother,” interposed renée, “i trust your wishes will not prosper, and that providence will only permit petty offenders, poor debtors, and miserable cheats to fall into m. de villefort’s hands,—then i shall be contented.” “just the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be called upon to prescribe for headaches, measles, and the stings of wasps, or any other slight affection of the epidermis.
Perplexity: 362902336.0000

Sentence: if you wish to see me the king’s attorney, you must desire for me some of those violent and dangerous diseases from the cure of which so much honor redounds to the physician.” at this moment, and as though the utterance of villefort’s wish had sufficed to effect its accomplishment, a servant entered the room, and whispered a few words in his ear.
Perplexity: 63417112.0000

Sentence: villefort immediately rose from table and quitted the room upon the plea of urgent business; he soon, however, returned, his whole face beaming with delight.
Perplexity: 796446336.0000

Sentence: renée regarded him with fond affection; and certainly his handsome features, lit up as they then were with more than usual fire and animation, seemed formed to excite the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful and intelligent lover.
Perplexity: 143090512.0000

Sentence: “you were wishing just now,” said villefort, addressing her, “that i were a doctor instead of a lawyer.
Perplexity: 494122176.0000

Sentence: well, i at least resemble the disciples of esculapius in one thing [people spoke in this style in 1815], that of not being able to call a day my own, not even that of my betrothal.” “and wherefore were you called away just now?” asked mademoiselle de saint-méran, with an air of deep interest.
Perplexity: 580520512.0000

Sentence: “for a very serious matter, which bids fair to make work for the executioner.” “how dreadful!” exclaimed renée, turning pale.
Perplexity: 29041394.0000

Sentence: “is it possible?” burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to the magistrate to hear his words.
Perplexity: 1188908288.0000

Sentence: “why, if my information prove correct, a sort of bonapartist conspiracy has just been discovered.” “can i believe my ears?” cried the marquise.
Perplexity: 773770176.0000

Sentence: “i will read you the letter containing the accusation, at least,” said villefort: “‘the king’s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the religious institutions of his country, that one named edmond dantès, mate of the ship _pharaon_, this day arrived from smyrna, after having touched at naples and porto-ferrajo, has been the bearer of a letter from murat to the usurper, and again taken charge of another letter from the usurper to the bonapartist club in paris.
Perplexity: 1396530304.0000

Sentence: ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the above-mentioned edmond dantès, who either carries the letter for paris about with him, or has it at his father’s abode.
Perplexity: 92962592.0000

Sentence: should it not be found in the possession of father or son, then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said dantès on board the _pharaon_.’” “but,” said renée, “this letter, which, after all, is but an anonymous scrawl, is not even addressed to you, but to the king’s attorney.” 0093m “true; but that gentleman being absent, his secretary, by his orders, opened his letters; thinking this one of importance, he sent for me, but not finding me, took upon himself to give the necessary orders for arresting the accused party.” “then the guilty person is absolutely in custody?” said the marquise.
Perplexity: 2889456384.0000

Sentence: “nay, dear mother, say the accused person.
Perplexity: 171291552.0000

Sentence: you know we cannot yet pronounce him guilty.” “he is in safe custody,” answered villefort; “and rely upon it, if the letter is found, he will not be likely to be trusted abroad again, unless he goes forth under the especial protection of the headsman.” “and where is the unfortunate being?” asked renée.
Perplexity: 354434880.0000

Sentence: “he is at my house.” “come, come, my friend,” interrupted the marquise, “do not neglect your duty to linger with us.
Perplexity: 1627926912.0000

Sentence: you are the king’s servant, and must go wherever that service calls you.” “oh, villefort!” cried renée, clasping her hands, and looking towards her lover with piteous earnestness, “be merciful on this the day of our betrothal.” the young man passed round to the side of the table where the fair pleader sat, and leaning over her chair said tenderly: “to give you pleasure, my sweet renée, i promise to show all the lenity in my power; but if the charges brought against this bonapartist hero prove correct, why, then, you really must give me leave to order his head to be cut off.” renée shuddered at the word _cut_, for the growth in question had a head.
Perplexity: 263939776.0000

Sentence: “never mind that foolish girl, villefort,” said the marquise.
Perplexity: 47111780.0000

Sentence: “she will soon get over these things.” so saying, madame de saint-méran extended her dry bony hand to villefort, who, while imprinting a son-in-law’s respectful salute on it, looked at renée, as much as to say, “i must try and fancy ’tis your dear hand i kiss, as it should have been.” “these are mournful auspices to accompany a betrothal,” sighed poor renée.
Perplexity: 489447232.0000

Sentence: “upon my word, child!” exclaimed the angry marquise, “your folly exceeds all bounds.
Perplexity: 249875520.0000

Sentence: i should be glad to know what connection there can possibly be between your sickly sentimentality and the affairs of the state!” “oh, mother!” murmured renée.
Perplexity: 24403304.0000

Sentence: “nay, madame, i pray you pardon this little traitor.
Perplexity: 56000216.0000

Sentence: i promise you that to make up for her want of loyalty, i will be most inflexibly severe;” then casting an expressive glance at his betrothed, which seemed to say, “fear not, for your dear sake my justice shall be tempered with mercy,” and receiving a sweet and approving smile in return, villefort departed with paradise in his heart.
Perplexity: 3605704704.0000

Sentence: the examination no sooner had villefort left the salon, than he assumed the grave air of a man who holds the balance of life and death in his hands.
Perplexity: 1112602240.0000

Sentence: now, in spite of the nobility of his countenance, the command of which, like a finished actor, he had carefully studied before the glass, it was by no means easy for him to assume an air of judicial severity.
Perplexity: 451986560.0000

Sentence: except the recollection of the line of politics his father had adopted, and which might interfere, unless he acted with the greatest prudence, with his own career, gérard de villefort was as happy as a man could be.
Perplexity: 73192992.0000

Sentence: already rich, he held a high official situation, though only twenty-seven.
Perplexity: 164647152.0000

Sentence: he was about to marry a young and charming woman, whom he loved, not passionately, but reasonably, as became a deputy attorney of the king; and besides her personal attractions, which were very great, mademoiselle de saint-méran’s family possessed considerable political influence, which they would, of course, exert in his favor.
Perplexity: 159622304.0000

Sentence: the dowry of his wife amounted to fifty thousand crowns, and he had, besides, the prospect of seeing her fortune increased to half a million at her father’s death.
Perplexity: 28629510.0000

Sentence: these considerations naturally gave villefort a feeling of such complete felicity that his mind was fairly dazzled in its contemplation.
Perplexity: 226957328.0000

Sentence: at the door he met the commissary of police, who was waiting for him.
Perplexity: 391375936.0000

Sentence: the sight of this officer recalled villefort from the third heaven to earth; he composed his face, as we have before described, and said, “i have read the letter, sir, and you have acted rightly in arresting this man; now inform me what you have discovered concerning him and the conspiracy.” “we know nothing as yet of the conspiracy, monsieur; all the papers found have been sealed up and placed on your desk.
Perplexity: 36900816.0000

Sentence: the prisoner himself is named edmond dantès, mate on board the three-master the _pharaon_, trading in cotton with alexandria and smyrna, and belonging to morrel & son, of marseilles.” “before he entered the merchant service, had he ever served in the marines?” “oh, no, monsieur, he is very young.” “how old?” “nineteen or twenty at the most.” at this moment, and as villefort had arrived at the corner of the rue des conseils, a man, who seemed to have been waiting for him, approached; it was m. morrel.
Perplexity: 34824752.0000

Sentence: “ah, m. de villefort,” cried he, “i am delighted to see you.
Perplexity: 757423168.0000

Sentence: some of your people have committed the strangest mistake—they have just arrested edmond dantès, mate of my vessel.” “i know it, monsieur,” replied villefort, “and i am now going to examine him.” “oh,” said morrel, carried away by his friendship, “you do not know him, and i do.
Perplexity: 119741448.0000

Sentence: he is the most estimable, the most trustworthy creature in the world, and i will venture to say, there is not a better seaman in all the merchant service.
Perplexity: 77956784.0000

Sentence: oh, m. de villefort, i beseech your indulgence for him.” villefort, as we have seen, belonged to the aristocratic party at marseilles, morrel to the plebeian; the first was a royalist, the other suspected of bonapartism.
Perplexity: 73299720.0000

Sentence: villefort looked disdainfully at morrel, and replied coldly: “you are aware, monsieur, that a man may be estimable and trustworthy in private life, and the best seaman in the merchant service, and yet be, politically speaking, a great criminal.
Perplexity: 23126144.0000

Sentence: is it not true?” the magistrate laid emphasis on these words, as if he wished to apply them to the owner himself, while his eyes seemed to plunge into the heart of one who, interceding for another, had himself need of indulgence.
Perplexity: 711602432.0000

Sentence: morrel reddened, for his own conscience was not quite clear on politics; besides, what dantès had told him of his interview with the grand-marshal, and what the emperor had said to him, embarrassed him.
Perplexity: 543132288.0000

Sentence: he replied, however, in a tone of deep interest: “i entreat you, m. de villefort, be, as you always are, kind and equitable, and give him back to us soon.” this _give us_ sounded revolutionary in the deputy’s ears.
Perplexity: 209188592.0000

Sentence: “ah, ah,” murmured he, “is dantès then a member of some carbonari society, that his protector thus employs the collective form?
Perplexity: 128192616.0000

Sentence: he was, if i recollect, arrested in a tavern, in company with a great many others.” then he added, “monsieur, you may rest assured i shall perform my duty impartially, and that if he be innocent you shall not have appealed to me in vain; should he, however, be guilty, in this present epoch, impunity would furnish a dangerous example, and i must do my duty.” 0097m as he had now arrived at the door of his own house, which adjoined the palais de justice, he entered, after having, coldly saluted the shipowner, who stood, as if petrified, on the spot where villefort had left him.
Perplexity: 707024256.0000

Sentence: the antechamber was full of police agents and gendarmes, in the midst of whom, carefully watched, but calm and smiling, stood the prisoner.
Perplexity: 55645024.0000

Sentence: villefort traversed the antechamber, cast a side glance at dantès, and taking a packet which a gendarme offered him, disappeared, saying, “bring in the prisoner.” rapid as had been villefort’s glance, it had served to give him an idea of the man he was about to interrogate.
Perplexity: 54747228.0000

Sentence: he had recognized intelligence in the high forehead, courage in the dark eye and bent brow, and frankness in the thick lips that showed a set of pearly teeth.
Perplexity: 318818176.0000

Sentence: villefort’s first impression was favorable; but he had been so often warned to mistrust first impulses, that he applied the maxim to the impression, forgetting the difference between the two words.
Perplexity: 478518816.0000

Sentence: he stifled, therefore, the feelings of compassion that were rising, composed his features, and sat down, grim and sombre, at his desk.
Perplexity: 23132850.0000

Sentence: an instant after dantès entered.
Perplexity: 72847168.0000

Sentence: he was pale, but calm and collected, and saluting his judge with easy politeness, looked round for a seat, as if he had been in m. morrel’s salon.
Perplexity: 439396704.0000

Sentence: it was then that he encountered for the first time villefort’s look,—that look peculiar to the magistrate, who, while seeming to read the thoughts of others, betrays nothing of his own.
Perplexity: 168707648.0000

Sentence: “who and what are you?” demanded villefort, turning over a pile of papers, containing information relative to the prisoner, that a police agent had given to him on his entry, and that, already, in an hour’s time, had swelled to voluminous proportions, thanks to the corrupt espionage of which “the accused” is always made the victim.
Perplexity: 4143813120.0000

Sentence: “my name is edmond dantès,” replied the young man calmly; “i am mate of the _pharaon_, belonging to messrs. morrel & son.” “your age?” continued villefort.
Perplexity: 492590240.0000

Sentence: “nineteen,” returned dantès.
Perplexity: 57438656.0000

Sentence: “what were you doing at the moment you were arrested?” “i was at the festival of my marriage, monsieur,” said the young man, his voice slightly tremulous, so great was the contrast between that happy moment and the painful ceremony he was now undergoing; so great was the contrast between the sombre aspect of m. de villefort and the radiant face of mercédès.
Perplexity: 87477976.0000

Sentence: “you were at the festival of your marriage?” said the deputy, shuddering in spite of himself.
Perplexity: 1414809856.0000

Sentence: “yes, monsieur; i am on the point of marrying a young girl i have been attached to for three years.” villefort, impassive as he was, was struck with this coincidence; and the tremulous voice of dantès, surprised in the midst of his happiness, struck a sympathetic chord in his own bosom—he also was on the point of being married, and he was summoned from his own happiness to destroy that of another.
Perplexity: 440149952.0000

Sentence: “this philosophic reflection,” thought he, “will make a great sensation at m. de saint-méran’s;” and he arranged mentally, while dantès awaited further questions, the antithesis by which orators often create a reputation for eloquence.
Perplexity: 73305448.0000

Sentence: when this speech was arranged, villefort turned to dantès.
Perplexity: 247551072.0000

Sentence: 0099m “go on, sir,” said he.
Perplexity: 316677600.0000

Sentence: “what would you have me say?” “give all the information in your power.” “tell me on which point you desire information, and i will tell all i know; only,” added he, with a smile, “i warn you i know very little.” “have you served under the usurper?” “i was about to be mustered into the royal marines when he fell.” “it is reported your political opinions are extreme,” said villefort, who had never heard anything of the kind, but was not sorry to make this inquiry, as if it were an accusation.
Perplexity: 80119352.0000

Sentence: “my political opinions!” replied dantès.
Perplexity: 308426816.0000

Sentence: “alas, sir, i never had any opinions.
Perplexity: 45990164.0000

Sentence: i am hardly nineteen; i know nothing; i have no part to play.
Perplexity: 61436676.0000

Sentence: if i obtain the situation i desire, i shall owe it to m. morrel.
Perplexity: 157113712.0000

Sentence: thus all my opinions—i will not say public, but private—are confined to these three sentiments,—i love my father, i respect m. morrel, and i adore mercédès.
Perplexity: 25518798.0000

Sentence: this, sir, is all i can tell you, and you see how uninteresting it is.” as dantès spoke, villefort gazed at his ingenuous and open countenance, and recollected the words of renée, who, without knowing who the culprit was, had besought his indulgence for him.
Perplexity: 26335422464.0000

Sentence: with the deputy’s knowledge of crime and criminals, every word the young man uttered convinced him more and more of his innocence.
Perplexity: 844781312.0000

Sentence: this lad, for he was scarcely a man,—simple, natural, eloquent with that eloquence of the heart never found when sought for; full of affection for everybody, because he was happy, and because happiness renders even the wicked good—extended his affection even to his judge, spite of villefort’s severe look and stern accent.
Perplexity: 86982344.0000

Sentence: dantès seemed full of kindness.
Perplexity: 150029648.0000

Sentence: _“pardieu!”_ said villefort, “he is a noble fellow.
Perplexity: 339599712.0000

Sentence: i hope i shall gain renée’s favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on me.
Perplexity: 535251616.0000

Sentence: i shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public, and a sweet kiss in private.” full of this idea, villefort’s face became so joyous, that when he turned to dantès, the latter, who had watched the change on his physiognomy, was smiling also.
Perplexity: 320994048.0000

Sentence: “sir,” said villefort, “have you any enemies, at least, that you know.” “i have enemies?” replied dantès; “my position is not sufficiently elevated for that.
Perplexity: 260289744.0000

Sentence: as for my disposition, that is, perhaps, somewhat too hasty; but i have striven to repress it.
Perplexity: 110523488.0000

Sentence: i have had ten or twelve sailors under me, and if you question them, they will tell you that they love and respect me, not as a father, for i am too young, but as an elder brother.” “but you may have excited jealousy.
Perplexity: 229186736.0000

Sentence: you are about to become captain at nineteen—an elevated post; you are about to marry a pretty girl, who loves you; and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the envy of someone.” “you are right; you know men better than i do, and what you say may possibly be the case, i confess; but if such persons are among my acquaintances i prefer not to know it, because then i should be forced to hate them.” “you are wrong; you should always strive to see clearly around you.
Perplexity: 442042080.0000

Perplexity: 49813608.0000

Perplexity: 165385872.0000

Sentence: i am very fortunate,” added he, looking gratefully at villefort, “to be examined by such a man as you; for this envious person is a real enemy.” and by the rapid glance that the young man’s eyes shot forth, villefort saw how much energy lay hid beneath this mildness.

Sentence: “now,” said the deputy, “answer me frankly, not as a prisoner to a judge, but as one man to another who takes an interest in him, what truth is there in the accusation contained in this anonymous letter?” and villefort threw disdainfully on his desk the letter dantès had just given back to him.

Perplexity: 179079040.0000

Sentence: “to whom is it addressed?” _“to monsieur noirtier, rue coq-héron, paris.”_ had a thunderbolt fallen into the room, villefort could not have been more stupefied.

Perplexity: 91546480.0000

Perplexity: 189216976.0000

Sentence: after reading the letter, villefort covered his face with his hands.
Perplexity: 256409328.0000

Perplexity: 215226304.0000

Sentence: “and you say that you are ignorant of the contents of this letter?” “i give you my word of honor, sir,” said dantès; “but what is the matter?

Perplexity: 105680720.0000

Sentence: “oh, it is impossible to doubt it,” cried he, suddenly.
Perplexity: 4038120704.0000

Sentence: “in heaven’s name!” cried the unhappy young man, “if you doubt me, question me; i will answer you.” villefort made a violent effort, and in a tone he strove to render firm: “sir,” said he, “i am no longer able, as i had hoped, to restore you immediately to liberty; before doing so, i must consult the trial justice; what my own feeling is you already know.” “oh, monsieur,” cried dantès, “you have been rather a friend than a judge.” 0105m “well, i must detain you some time longer, but i will strive to make it as short as possible.
Perplexity: 49636444.0000

Perplexity: 58664332.0000

Sentence: should anyone else interrogate you, say to him what you have said to me, but do not breathe a word of this letter.” “i promise.” it was villefort who seemed to entreat, and the prisoner who reassured him.

Sentence: “you see,” continued he, glancing toward the grate, where fragments of burnt paper fluttered in the flames, “the letter is destroyed; you and i alone know of its existence; should you, therefore, be questioned, deny all knowledge of it—deny it boldly, and you are saved.” “be satisfied; i will deny it.” “it was the only letter you had?” “it was.” “swear it.” “i swear it.” villefort rang.

Perplexity: 48055640.0000

Sentence: “this will do,” said he, “and from this letter, which might have ruined me, i will make my fortune.

Perplexity: 41659508.0000

Sentence: he was conducted to a tolerably neat chamber, but grated and barred, and its appearance, therefore, did not greatly alarm him; besides, the words of villefort, who seemed to interest himself so much, resounded still in his ears like a promise of freedom.

Sentence: i am captain dantès, a loyal frenchman, thought accused of treason; tell me where you are conducting me, and i promise you on my honor i will submit to my fate.” the gendarme looked irresolutely at his companion, who returned for answer a sign that said, “i see no great harm in telling him now,” and the gendarme replied: “you are a native of marseilles, and a sailor, and yet you do not know where you are going?” “on my honor, i have no idea.” “have you no idea whatever?” “none at all.” “that is impossible.” “i swear to you it is true.

Perplexity: 2634791936.0000

Sentence: come, come, do not look so astonished, or you will make me think you are laughing at me in return for my good nature.” dantès pressed the gendarme’s hand as though he would crush it.
Perplexity: 56585376.0000

Sentence: “you think, then,” said he, “that i am taken to the château d’if to be imprisoned there?” “it is probable; but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard.” “without any inquiry, without any formality?” “all the formalities have been gone through; the inquiry is already made.” “and so, in spite of m. de villefort’s promises?” “i do not know what m. de villefort promised you,” said the gendarme, “but i know we are taking you to the château d’if.

Perplexity: 118953360.0000

Perplexity: 222088816.0000

Perplexity: 329866528.0000

Perplexity: 224781728.0000

Sentence: the prisoner followed his guide, who led him into a room almost under ground, whose bare and reeking walls seemed as though impregnated with tears; a lamp placed on a stool illumined the apartment faintly, and showed dantès the features of his conductor, an under-jailer, ill-clothed, and of sullen appearance.

Perplexity: 137988064.0000

Sentence: the day passed thus; he scarcely tasted food, but walked round and round the cell like a wild beast in its cage.
Perplexity: 109473624.0000

Sentence: one thought in particular tormented him: namely, that during his journey hither he had sat so still, whereas he might, a dozen times, have plunged into the sea, and, thanks to his powers of swimming, for which he was famous, have gained the shore, concealed himself until the arrival of a genoese or spanish vessel, escaped to spain or italy, where mercédès and his father could have joined him.

Perplexity: 63799036.0000

Sentence: “come, cheer up; is there anything that i can do for you?” “i wish to see the governor.” “i have already told you it was impossible.” “why so?” “because it is against prison rules, and prisoners must not even ask for it.” “what is allowed, then?” “better fare, if you pay for it, books, and leave to walk about.” “i do not want books, i am satisfied with my food, and do not care to walk about; but i wish to see the governor.” “if you worry me by repeating the same thing, i will not bring you any more to eat.” “well, then,” said edmond, “if you do not, i shall die of hunger—that is all.” the jailer saw by his tone he would be happy to die; and as every prisoner is worth ten sous a day to his jailer, he replied in a more subdued tone.
Perplexity: 449309088.0000

Sentence: “what you ask is impossible; but if you are very well behaved you will be allowed to walk about, and some day you will meet the governor, and if he chooses to reply, that is his affair.” “but,” asked dantès, “how long shall i have to wait?” “ah, a month—six months—a year.” “it is too long a time.

Perplexity: 611070208.0000

Perplexity: 48923884.0000

Perplexity: 43833256.0000

Sentence: “come in,” said louis xviii., with repressed smile, “come in, baron, and tell the duke all you know—the latest news of m. de bonaparte; do not conceal anything, however serious,—let us see, the island of elba is a volcano, and we may expect to have issuing thence flaming and bristling war—_bella, horrida bella_.” m. dandré leaned very respectfully on the back of a chair with his two hands, and said: “has your majesty perused yesterday’s report?” “yes, yes; but tell the duke himself, who cannot find anything, what the report contains—give him the particulars of what the usurper is doing in his islet.” “monsieur,” said the baron to the duke, “all the servants of his majesty must approve of the latest intelligence which we have from the island of elba.
Perplexity: 338355744.0000

Perplexity: 12074264576.0000

Perplexity: 64510952.0000

Sentence: sometimes he weeps bitterly, sometimes laughs boisterously, at other time he passes hours on the seashore, flinging stones in the water and when the flint makes ‘duck-and-drake’ five or six times, he appears as delighted as if he had gained another marengo or austerlitz.
Perplexity: 51757564.0000

Sentence: now, you must agree that these are indubitable symptoms of insanity.” “or of wisdom, my dear baron—or of wisdom,” said louis xviii., laughing; “the greatest captains of antiquity amused themselves by casting pebbles into the ocean—see plutarch’s life of scipio africanus.” m. de blacas pondered deeply between the confident monarch and the truthful minister.
Perplexity: 43660204.0000

Sentence: villefort, who did not choose to reveal the whole secret, lest another should reap all the benefit of the disclosure, had yet communicated enough to cause him the greatest uneasiness.
Perplexity: 164107584.0000

Perplexity: 128686984.0000

Sentence: “the usurper’s conversion!” murmured the duke, looking at the king and dandré, who spoke alternately, like virgil’s shepherds.

Perplexity: 157413968.0000

Sentence: tell him all about it, baron.” “why, this is the way of it,” said the minister, with the gravest air in the world: “napoleon lately had a review, and as two or three of his old veterans expressed a desire to return to france, he gave them their dismissal, and exhorted them to ‘serve the good king.’ these were his own words, of that i am certain.” “well, blacas, what think you of this?” inquired the king triumphantly, and pausing for a moment from the voluminous scholiast before him.
Perplexity: 304613248.0000

Sentence: “i say, sire, that the minister of police is greatly deceived or i am; and as it is impossible it can be the minister of police as he has the guardianship of the safety and honor of your majesty, it is probable that i am in error.
Perplexity: 110635056.0000

Sentence: however, sire, if i might advise, your majesty will interrogate the person of whom i spoke to you, and i will urge your majesty to do him this honor.” “most willingly, duke; under your auspices i will receive any person you please, but you must not expect me to be too confiding.
Perplexity: 633646656.0000

Sentence: baron, have you any report more recent than this, dated the 20th february, and this is the 3rd of march?” “no, sire, but i am hourly expecting one; it may have arrived since i left my office.” “go thither, and if there be none—well, well,” continued louis xviii., “make one; that is the usual way, is it not?” and the king laughed facetiously.
Perplexity: 233156288.0000

Sentence: “oh, sire,” replied the minister, “we have no occasion to invent any; every day our desks are loaded with most circumstantial denunciations, coming from hosts of people who hope for some return for services which they seek to render, but cannot; they trust to fortune, and rely upon some unexpected event in some way to justify their predictions.” “well, sir, go,” said louis xviii., “and remember that i am waiting for you.” “i will but go and return, sire; i shall be back in ten minutes.” “and i, sire,” said m. de blacas, “will go and find my messenger.” “wait, sir, wait,” said louis xviii.
Perplexity: 651495296.0000

Sentence: “really, m. de blacas, i must change your armorial bearings; i will give you an eagle with outstretched wings, holding in its claws a prey which tries in vain to escape, and bearing this device—_tenax_.” 0133m “sire, i listen,” said de blacas, biting his nails with impatience.
Perplexity: 234661568.0000

Perplexity: 78049472.0000

Sentence: well, then, what do you think of the _molli anhelitu_?” “admirable, sire; but my messenger is like the stag you refer to, for he has posted two hundred and twenty leagues in scarcely three days.” “which is undergoing great fatigue and anxiety, my dear duke, when we have a telegraph which transmits messages in three or four hours, and that without getting in the least out of breath.” “ah, sire, you recompense but badly this poor young man, who has come so far, and with so much ardor, to give your majesty useful information.
Perplexity: 197630128.0000

Sentence: if only for the sake of m. de salvieux, who recommends him to me, i entreat your majesty to receive him graciously.” “m.

Sentence: de salvieux, my brother’s chamberlain?” “yes, sire.” “he is at marseilles.” “and writes me thence.” “does he speak to you of this conspiracy?” “no; but strongly recommends m. de villefort, and begs me to present him to your majesty.” “m.
Perplexity: 279534176.0000

Sentence: de villefort!” cried the king, “is the messenger’s name m. de villefort?” “yes, sire.” “and he comes from marseilles?” “in person.” “why did you not mention his name at once?” replied the king, betraying some uneasiness.
Perplexity: 32426888.0000

Sentence: “sire, i thought his name was unknown to your majesty.” “no, no, blacas; he is a man of strong and elevated understanding, ambitious, too, and, _pardieu!_ you know his father’s name!” “his father?” “yes, noirtier.” “noirtier the girondin?—noirtier the senator?” “he himself.” “and your majesty has employed the son of such a man?” “blacas, my friend, you have but limited comprehension.
Perplexity: 782344832.0000

Sentence: i told you villefort was ambitious, and to attain this ambition villefort would sacrifice everything, even his father.” “then, sire, may i present him?” “this instant, duke!
Perplexity: 99379024.0000

Sentence: where is he?” “waiting below, in my carriage.” “seek him at once.” “i hasten to do so.” the duke left the royal presence with the speed of a young man; his really sincere royalism made him youthful again.

Sentence: louis xviii.
Perplexity: 302413440.0000

Sentence: remained alone, and turning his eyes on his half-opened horace, muttered: “_justum et tenacem propositi virum_.” m. de blacas returned as speedily as he had departed, but in the antechamber he was forced to appeal to the king’s authority.
Perplexity: 47812904.0000

Sentence: villefort’s dusty garb, his costume, which was not of courtly cut, excited the susceptibility of m. de brezé, who was all astonishment at finding that this young man had the audacity to enter before the king in such attire.
Perplexity: 55826380.0000

Sentence: the duke, however, overcame all difficulties with a word—his majesty’s order; and, in spite of the protestations which the master of ceremonies made for the honor of his office and principles, villefort was introduced.

Sentence: the king was seated in the same place where the duke had left him.

Sentence: de villefort,” said louis xviii., “the duc de blacas assures me you have some interesting information to communicate.” “sire, the duke is right, and i believe your majesty will think it equally important.” 0137m “in the first place, and before everything else, sir, is the news as bad in your opinion as i am asked to believe?” “sire, i believe it to be most urgent, but i hope, by the speed i have used, that it is not irreparable.” “speak as fully as you please, sir,” said the king, who began to give way to the emotion which had showed itself in blacas’s face and affected villefort’s voice.
Perplexity: 442648704.0000

Sentence: “speak, sir, and pray begin at the beginning; i like order in everything.” “sire,” said villefort, “i will render a faithful report to your majesty, but i must entreat your forgiveness if my anxiety leads to some obscurity in my language.” a glance at the king after this discreet and subtle exordium, assured villefort of the benignity of his august auditor, and he went on: “sire, i have come as rapidly to paris as possible, to inform your majesty that i have discovered, in the exercise of my duties, not a commonplace and insignificant plot, such as is every day got up in the lower ranks of the people and in the army, but an actual conspiracy—a storm which menaces no less than your majesty’s throne.
Perplexity: 2691205120.0000

Sentence: your majesty is well aware that the sovereign of the island of elba has maintained his relations with italy and france?” “i am, sir,” said the king, much agitated; “and recently we have had information that the bonapartist clubs have had meetings in the rue saint-jacques.
Perplexity: 78418344.0000

Sentence: but proceed, i beg of you.
Perplexity: 91146104.0000

Perplexity: 38344512.0000

Sentence: this person, a sailor, of turbulent character, and whom i suspected of bonapartism, has been secretly to the island of elba.
Perplexity: 1783813120.0000

Sentence: there he saw the grand-marshal, who charged him with an oral message to a bonapartist in paris, whose name i could not extract from him; but this mission was to prepare men’s minds for a return (it is the man who says this, sire)—a return which will soon occur.” “and where is this man?” “in prison, sire.” “and the matter seems serious to you?” “so serious, sire, that when the circumstance surprised me in the midst of a family festival, on the very day of my betrothal, i left my bride and friends, postponing everything, that i might hasten to lay at your majesty’s feet the fears which impressed me, and the assurance of my devotion.” “true,” said louis xviii., “was there not a marriage engagement between you and mademoiselle de saint-méran?” “daughter of one of your majesty’s most faithful servants.” “yes, yes; but let us talk of this plot, m. de villefort.” “sire, i fear it is more than a plot; i fear it is a conspiracy.” “a conspiracy in these times,” said louis xviii., smiling, “is a thing very easy to meditate, but more difficult to conduct to an end, inasmuch as, re-established so recently on the throne of our ancestors, we have our eyes open at once upon the past, the present, and the future.

Perplexity: 30729338.0000

Sentence: if bonaparte landed at naples, the whole coalition would be on foot before he could even reach piombino; if he land in tuscany, he will be in an unfriendly territory; if he land in france, it must be with a handful of men, and the result of that is easily foretold, execrated as he is by the population.
Perplexity: 1899185152.0000

Sentence: “you appear quite aghast.
Perplexity: 1717850240.0000

Sentence: has your uneasiness anything to do with what m. de blacas has told me, and m. de villefort has just confirmed?” m. de blacas moved suddenly towards the baron, but the fright of the courtier pleaded for the forbearance of the statesman; and besides, as matters were, it was much more to his advantage that the prefect of police should triumph over him than that he should humiliate the prefect.
Perplexity: 59233028.0000

Sentence: “sire,——” stammered the baron.

Sentence: well, sir, what you tell me is impossible.
Perplexity: 46274280.0000

Perplexity: 611107520.0000

Sentence: will your majesty deign to excuse me?” “speak, sir, speak boldly,” replied louis.
Perplexity: 141493600.0000

Sentence: “you alone forewarned us of the evil; now try and aid us with the remedy.” “sire,” said villefort, “the usurper is detested in the south; and it seems to me that if he ventured into the south, it would be easy to raise languedoc and provence against him.” “yes, assuredly,” replied the minister; “but he is advancing by gap and sisteron.” “advancing—he is advancing!” said louis xviii.
Perplexity: 103845032.0000

Sentence: “is he then advancing on paris?” the minister of police maintained a silence which was equivalent to a complete avowal.

Perplexity: 121061216.0000

Perplexity: 39854344.0000

Perplexity: 110867000.0000

Perplexity: 176398880.0000

Perplexity: 91869384.0000

Sentence: “what our enemies say of us is then true.
Perplexity: 2412435968.0000

Sentence: we have learnt nothing, forgotten nothing!
Perplexity: 83966288.0000

Sentence: if i were betrayed as he was, i would console myself; but to be in the midst of persons elevated by myself to places of honor, who ought to watch over me more carefully than over themselves,—for my fortune is theirs—before me they were nothing—after me they will be nothing, and perish miserably from incapacity—ineptitude!
Perplexity: 20333528.0000

Sentence: oh, yes, sir, you are right—it is fatality!” the minister quailed before this outburst of sarcasm.
Perplexity: 1034739776.0000

Sentence: m. de blacas wiped the moisture from his brow.
Perplexity: 57290072.0000

Perplexity: 1899185152.0000

Sentence: oh, i would rather mount the scaffold of my brother, louis xvi., than thus descend the staircase at the tuileries driven away by ridicule.
Perplexity: 175391056.0000

Sentence: ridicule, sir—why, you know not its power in france, and yet you ought to know it!” “sire, sire,” murmured the minister, “for pity’s——” “approach, m. de villefort,” resumed the king, addressing the young man, who, motionless and breathless, was listening to a conversation on which depended the destiny of a kingdom.
Perplexity: 213315680.0000

Sentence: “approach, and tell monsieur that it is possible to know beforehand all that he has not known.” “sire, it was really impossible to learn secrets which that man concealed from all the world.” “really impossible!
Perplexity: 159375872.0000

Sentence: yes—that is a great word, sir.
Perplexity: 561033024.0000

Sentence: unfortunately, there are great words, as there are great men; i have measured them.
Perplexity: 34354100.0000

Sentence: really impossible for a minister who has an office, agents, spies, and fifteen hundred thousand francs for secret service money, to know what is going on at sixty leagues from the coast of france!
Perplexity: 529179232.0000

Sentence: well, then, see, here is a gentleman who had none of these resources at his disposal—a gentleman, only a simple magistrate, who learned more than you with all your police, and who would have saved my crown, if, like you, he had the power of directing a telegraph.” the look of the minister of police was turned with concentrated spite on villefort, who bent his head in modest triumph.
Perplexity: 340802048.0000

Sentence: “i do not mean that for you, blacas,” continued louis xviii.

Perplexity: 279296480.0000

Sentence: villefort understood the king’s intent.
Perplexity: 297304448.0000

Sentence: any other person would, perhaps, have been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise; but he feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police minister, although he saw that dandré was irrevocably lost.
Perplexity: 89105552.0000

Sentence: in fact, the minister, who, in the plenitude of his power, had been unable to unearth napoleon’s secret, might in despair at his own downfall interrogate dantès and so lay bare the motives of villefort’s plot.
Perplexity: 441065984.0000

Sentence: realizing this, villefort came to the rescue of the crest-fallen minister, instead of aiding to crush him.
Perplexity: 84123064.0000

Sentence: “sire,” said villefort, “the suddenness of this event must prove to your majesty that the issue is in the hands of providence; what your majesty is pleased to attribute to me as profound perspicacity is simply owing to chance, and i have profited by that chance, like a good and devoted servant—that’s all.
Perplexity: 137951472.0000

Sentence: do not attribute to me more than i deserve, sire, that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the first opinion you have been pleased to form of me.” the minister of police thanked the young man by an eloquent look, and villefort understood that he had succeeded in his design; that is to say, that without forfeiting the gratitude of the king, he had made a friend of one on whom, in case of necessity, he might rely.
Perplexity: 34523112.0000

Sentence: “’tis well,” resumed the king.
Perplexity: 765177216.0000

Sentence: “and now, gentlemen,” he continued, turning towards m. de blacas and the minister of police, “i have no further occasion for you, and you may retire; what now remains to do is in the department of the minister of war.” “fortunately, sire,” said m. de blacas, “we can rely on the army; your majesty knows how every report confirms their loyalty and attachment.” “do not mention reports, duke, to me, for i know now what confidence to place in them.
Perplexity: 543928512.0000

Sentence: yet, speaking of reports, baron, what have you learned with regard to the affair in the rue saint-jacques?” “the affair in the rue saint-jacques!” exclaimed villefort, unable to repress an exclamation.
Perplexity: 660393088.0000

Sentence: then, suddenly pausing, he added, “your pardon, sire, but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget, not the respect i have, for that is too deeply engraved in my heart, but the rules of etiquette.” “go on, go on, sir,” replied the king; “you have today earned the right to make inquiries here.” “sire,” interposed the minister of police, “i came a moment ago to give your majesty fresh information which i had obtained on this head, when your majesty’s attention was attracted by the terrible event that has occurred in the gulf, and now these facts will cease to interest your majesty.” “on the contrary, sir,—on the contrary,” said louis xviii., “this affair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which occupies our attention, and the death of general quesnel will, perhaps, put us on the direct track of a great internal conspiracy.” at the name of general quesnel, villefort trembled.
Perplexity: 664850624.0000

Sentence: “everything points to the conclusion, sire,” said the minister of police, “that death was not the result of suicide, as we first believed, but of assassination.
Perplexity: 330647008.0000

Sentence: general quesnel, it appears, had just left a bonapartist club when he disappeared.
Perplexity: 129070712.0000

Sentence: an unknown person had been with him that morning, and made an appointment with him in the rue saint-jacques; unfortunately, the general’s valet, who was dressing his hair at the moment when the stranger entered, heard the street mentioned, but did not catch the number.” as the police minister related this to the king, villefort, who looked as if his very life hung on the speaker’s lips, turned alternately red and pale.
Perplexity: 581139840.0000

Sentence: the king looked towards him.
Perplexity: 104233376.0000

Sentence: “do you not think with me, m. de villefort, that general quesnel, whom they believed attached to the usurper, but who was really entirely devoted to me, has perished the victim of a bonapartist ambush?” “it is probable, sire,” replied villefort.
Perplexity: 74157528.0000

Sentence: “but is this all that is known?” “they are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with him.” “on his track?” said villefort.

Sentence: yesterday a person exactly corresponding with this description was followed, but he was lost sight of at the corner of the rue de la jussienne and the rue coq-héron.” villefort leaned on the back of an armchair, for as the minister of police went on speaking he felt his legs bend under him; but when he learned that the unknown had escaped the vigilance of the agent who followed him, he breathed again.
Perplexity: 345674080.0000

Sentence: “continue to seek for this man, sir,” said the king to the minister of police; “for if, as i am all but convinced, general quesnel, who would have been so useful to us at this moment, has been murdered, his assassins, bonapartists or not, shall be cruelly punished.” it required all villefort’s coolness not to betray the terror with which this declaration of the king inspired him.
Perplexity: 444834912.0000

Sentence: “how strange,” continued the king, with some asperity; “the police think that they have disposed of the whole matter when they say, ‘a murder has been committed,’ and especially so when they can add, ‘and we are on the track of the guilty persons.’” “sire, your majesty will, i trust, be amply satisfied on this point at least.” “we shall see.

Sentence: 0145m “no, sire,” he replied, “i alighted at the hotel de madrid, in the rue de tournon.” “but you have seen him?” “sire, i went straight to the duc de blacas.” “but you will see him, then?” “i think not, sire.” “ah, i forgot,” said louis, smiling in a manner which proved that all these questions were not made without a motive; “i forgot you and m. noirtier are not on the best terms possible, and that is another sacrifice made to the royal cause, and for which you should be recompensed.” “sire, the kindness your majesty deigns to evince towards me is a recompense which so far surpasses my utmost ambition that i have nothing more to ask for.” “never mind, sir, we will not forget you; make your mind easy.
Perplexity: 51872896.0000

Sentence: in the meanwhile” (the king here detached the cross of the legion of honor which he usually wore over his blue coat, near the cross of st. louis, above the order of notre-dame-du-mont-carmel and st. lazare, and gave it to villefort)—“in the meanwhile take this cross.” “sire,” said villefort, “your majesty mistakes; this is an officer’s cross.” “_ma foi!_” said louis xviii., “take it, such as it is, for i have not the time to procure you another.
Perplexity: 1017173504.0000

Sentence: blacas, let it be your care to see that the brevet is made out and sent to m. de villefort.” villefort’s eyes were filled with tears of joy and pride; he took the cross and kissed it.

Sentence: “and now,” he said, “may i inquire what are the orders with which your majesty deigns to honor me?” “take what rest you require, and remember that if you are not able to serve me here in paris, you may be of the greatest service to me at marseilles.” “sire,” replied villefort, bowing, “in an hour i shall have quitted paris.” “go, sir,” said the king; “and should i forget you (kings’ memories are short), do not be afraid to bring yourself to my recollection.
Perplexity: 47554516.0000

Sentence: baron, send for the minister of war.
Perplexity: 1441498752.0000

Sentence: blacas, remain.” “ah, sir,” said the minister of police to villefort, as they left the tuileries, “you entered by luck’s door—your fortune is made.” “will it be long first?” muttered villefort, saluting the minister, whose career was ended, and looking about him for a hackney-coach.
Perplexity: 280412608.0000

Sentence: one passed at the moment, which he hailed; he gave his address to the driver, and springing in, threw himself on the seat, and gave loose to dreams of ambition.

Sentence: the valet entered.
Perplexity: 33346902.0000

Sentence: “well,” said villefort, “what is it?—who rang?—who asked for me?” “a stranger who will not send in his name.” “a stranger who will not send in his name!
Perplexity: 1812477952.0000

Sentence: what can he want with me?” “he wishes to speak to you.” “to me?” “yes.” “did he mention my name?” “yes.” “what sort of person is he?” “why, sir, a man of about fifty.” “short or tall?” “about your own height, sir.” “dark or fair?” “dark,—very dark; with black eyes, black hair, black eyebrows.” “and how dressed?” asked villefort quickly.
Perplexity: 83966288.0000

Sentence: “in a blue frock-coat, buttoned up close, decorated with the legion of honor.” “it is he!” said villefort, turning pale.

Perplexity: 1034739776.0000

Sentence: is it the custom in marseilles for sons to keep their fathers waiting in their anterooms?” “father!” cried villefort, “then i was not deceived; i felt sure it must be you.” “well, then, if you felt so sure,” replied the new-comer, putting his cane in a corner and his hat on a chair, “allow me to say, my dear gérard, that it was not very filial of you to keep me waiting at the door.” “leave us, germain,” said villefort.

Perplexity: 22366582.0000

Sentence: father and son m. noirtier—for it was, indeed, he who entered—looked after the servant until the door was closed, and then, fearing, no doubt, that he might be overheard in the antechamber, he opened the door again, nor was the precaution useless, as appeared from the rapid retreat of germain, who proved that he was not exempt from the sin which ruined our first parents.
Perplexity: 1899185152.0000

Sentence: m. noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the antechamber door, then that of the bedchamber, and then extended his hand to villefort, who had followed all his motions with surprise which he could not conceal.
Perplexity: 262348736.0000

Sentence: “well, now, my dear gérard,” said he to the young man, with a very significant look, “do you know, you seem as if you were not very glad to see me?” “my dear father,” said villefort, “i am, on the contrary, delighted; but i so little expected your visit, that it has somewhat overcome me.” “but, my dear fellow,” replied m. noirtier, seating himself, “i might say the same thing to you, when you announce to me your wedding for the 28th of february, and on the 3rd of march you turn up here in paris.” “and if i have come, my dear father,” said gérard, drawing closer to m. noirtier, “do not complain, for it is for you that i came, and my journey will be your salvation.” “ah, indeed!” said m. noirtier, stretching himself out at his ease in the chair.

Perplexity: 155635248.0000

Sentence: but go on, what about the club in the rue saint-jacques?” “why, they induced general quesnel to go there, and general quesnel, who quitted his own house at nine o’clock in the evening, was found the next day in the seine.” 0151m “and who told you this fine story?” “the king himself.” “well, then, in return for your story,” continued noirtier, “i will tell you another.” “my dear father, i think i already know what you are about to tell me.” “ah, you have heard of the landing of the emperor?” “not so loud, father, i entreat of you—for your own sake as well as mine.

Perplexity: 57693280.0000

Sentence: i know you too well to suppose you would allow such a thing to pass you.” “i burnt it, for fear that even a fragment should remain; for that letter must have led to your condemnation.” “and the destruction of your future prospects,” replied noirtier; “yes, i can easily comprehend that.
Perplexity: 268625504.0000

Sentence: but i have nothing to fear while i have you to protect me.” “i do better than that, sir—i save you.” “you do?
Perplexity: 718485632.0000

Perplexity: 34458180.0000

Perplexity: 1451566464.0000

Perplexity: 438434784.0000

Perplexity: 1149800192.0000

Perplexity: 35242516.0000

Sentence: and what may be that description?” “dark complexion; hair, eyebrows, and whiskers black; blue frock-coat, buttoned up to the chin; rosette of an officer of the legion of honor in his button-hole; a hat with wide brim, and a cane.” “ah, ha, that’s it, is it?” said noirtier; “and why, then, have they not laid hands on him?” “because yesterday, or the day before, they lost sight of him at the corner of the rue coq-héron.” “didn’t i say that your police were good for nothing?” “yes; but they may catch him yet.” “true,” said noirtier, looking carelessly around him, “true, if this person were not on his guard, as he is;” and he added with a smile, “he will consequently make a few changes in his personal appearance.” at these words he rose, and put off his frock-coat and cravat, went towards a table on which lay his son’s toilet articles, lathered his face, took a razor, and, with a firm hand, cut off the compromising whiskers.

Perplexity: 419231264.0000

Sentence: “well,” he said, turning towards his wondering son, when this disguise was completed, “well, do you think your police will recognize me now.” “no, father,” stammered villefort; “at least, i hope not.” “and now, my dear boy,” continued noirtier, “i rely on your prudence to remove all the things which i leave in your care.” “oh, rely on me,” said villefort.

Perplexity: 4783483904.0000

Sentence: “you are not convinced yet?” “i hope at least, that you may be mistaken.” “shall you see the king again?” “perhaps.” “would you pass in his eyes for a prophet?” “prophets of evil are not in favor at the court, father.” “true, but some day they do them justice; and supposing a second restoration, you would then pass for a great man.” “well, what should i say to the king?” “say this to him: ‘sire, you are deceived as to the feeling in france, as to the opinions of the towns, and the prejudices of the army; he whom in paris you call the corsican ogre, who at nevers is styled the usurper, is already saluted as bonaparte at lyons, and emperor at grenoble.

Perplexity: 67126600.0000

Sentence: sire, go, leave france to its real master, to him who acquired it, not by purchase, but by right of conquest; go, sire, not that you incur any risk, for your adversary is powerful enough to show you mercy, but because it would be humiliating for a grandson of saint louis to owe his life to the man of arcola, marengo, austerlitz.’ tell him this, gérard; or, rather, tell him nothing.
Perplexity: 44912292.0000

Sentence: keep your journey a secret; do not boast of what you have come to paris to do, or have done; return with all speed; enter marseilles at night, and your house by the back-door, and there remain, quiet, submissive, secret, and, above all, inoffensive; for this time, i swear to you, we shall act like powerful men who know their enemies.
Perplexity: 131200584.0000

Perplexity: 41295748.0000

Sentence: adieu, my dear gérard, and at your next journey alight at my door.” noirtier left the room when he had finished, with the same calmness that had characterized him during the whole of this remarkable and trying conversation.

Sentence: villefort, pale and agitated, ran to the window, put aside the curtain, and saw him pass, cool and collected, by two or three ill-looking men at the corner of the street, who were there, perhaps, to arrest a man with black whiskers, and a blue frock-coat, and hat with broad brim.
Perplexity: 114872984.0000

Sentence: villefort stood watching, breathless, until his father had disappeared at the rue bussy.
Perplexity: 83679304.0000

Sentence: villefort, therefore, gained nothing save the king’s gratitude (which was rather likely to injure him at the present time) and the cross of the legion of honor, which he had the prudence not to wear, although m. de blacas had duly forwarded the brevet.
Perplexity: 34324888.0000

Sentence: napoleon would, doubtless, have deprived villefort of his office had it not been for noirtier, who was all powerful at court, and thus the girondin of ’93 and the senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had been his protector.

Sentence: however, scarcely was the imperial power established—that is, scarcely had the emperor re-entered the tuileries and begun to issue orders from the closet into which we have introduced our readers,—he found on the table there louis xviii.’s half-filled snuff-box,—scarcely had this occurred when marseilles began, in spite of the authorities, to rekindle the flames of civil war, always smouldering in the south, and it required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater violence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the royalists whenever they ventured abroad.
Perplexity: 128363400.0000

Sentence: 0159m owing to this change, the worthy shipowner became at that moment—we will not say all powerful, because morrel was a prudent and rather a timid man, so much so, that many of the most zealous partisans of bonaparte accused him of “moderation”—but sufficiently influential to make a demand in favor of dantès.
Perplexity: 138200624.0000

Sentence: villefort retained his place, but his marriage was put off until a more favorable opportunity.
Perplexity: 52055068.0000

Perplexity: 190706128.0000

Sentence: the deputy procureur was, therefore, the first magistrate of marseilles, when one morning his door opened, and m. morrel was announced.
Perplexity: 215478096.0000

Sentence: anyone else would have hastened to receive him; but villefort was a man of ability, and he knew this would be a sign of weakness.
Perplexity: 42820228.0000

Sentence: he made morrel wait in the antechamber, although he had no one with him, for the simple reason that the king’s procureur always makes everyone wait, and after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers, he ordered m. morrel to be admitted.
Perplexity: 56942340.0000

Sentence: morrel expected villefort would be dejected; he found him as he had found him six weeks before, calm, firm, and full of that glacial politeness, that most insurmountable barrier which separates the well-bred from the vulgar man.
Perplexity: 83323032.0000

Sentence: he had entered villefort’s office expecting that the magistrate would tremble at the sight of him; on the contrary, he felt a cold shudder all over him when he saw villefort sitting there with his elbow on his desk, and his head leaning on his hand.
Perplexity: 112460288.0000

Sentence: he stopped at the door; villefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him; then, after a brief interval, during which the honest shipowner turned his hat in his hands, “m.

Sentence: morrel, i believe?” said villefort.
Perplexity: 46736324.0000

Perplexity: 396765024.0000

Sentence: “not in the least; but if i can serve you in any way i shall be delighted.” “everything depends on you.” “explain yourself, pray.” “monsieur,” said morrel, recovering his assurance as he proceeded, “do you recollect that a few days before the landing of his majesty the emperor, i came to intercede for a young man, the mate of my ship, who was accused of being concerned in correspondence with the island of elba?
Perplexity: 203202784.0000

Sentence: what was the other day a crime is today a title to favor.
Perplexity: 44765960.0000

Sentence: you then served louis xviii., and you did not show any favor—it was your duty; today you serve napoleon, and you ought to protect him—it is equally your duty; i come, therefore, to ask what has become of him?” 0161m villefort by a strong effort sought to control himself.
Perplexity: 263120976.0000

Sentence: “what is his name?” said he.
Perplexity: 769039872.0000

Sentence: “tell me his name.” “edmond dantès.” villefort would probably have rather stood opposite the muzzle of a pistol at five-and-twenty paces than have heard this name spoken; but he did not blanch.
Perplexity: 403270784.0000

Sentence: “dantès,” repeated he, “edmond dantès.” “yes, monsieur.” villefort opened a large register, then went to a table, from the table turned to his registers, and then, turning to morrel, “are you quite sure you are not mistaken, monsieur?” said he, in the most natural tone in the world.
Perplexity: 169785840.0000

Sentence: had morrel been a more quick-sighted man, or better versed in these matters, he would have been surprised at the king’s procureur answering him on such a subject, instead of referring him to the governors of the prison or the prefect of the department.
Perplexity: 396859616.0000

Sentence: but morrel, disappointed in his expectations of exciting fear, was conscious only of the other’s condescension.

Perplexity: 36650056.0000

Sentence: you received me very coldly.
Perplexity: 1065124864.0000

Sentence: oh, the royalists were very severe with the bonapartists in those days.” “monsieur,” returned villefort, “i was then a royalist, because i believed the bourbons not only the heirs to the throne, but the chosen of the nation.
Perplexity: 137346048.0000

Sentence: the miraculous return of napoleon has conquered me, the legitimate monarch is he who is loved by his people.” “that’s right!” cried morrel.
Perplexity: 195833504.0000

Sentence: “i like to hear you speak thus, and i augur well for edmond from it.” “wait a moment,” said villefort, turning over the leaves of a register; “i have it—a sailor, who was about to marry a young catalan girl.
Perplexity: 174651632.0000

Sentence: i recollect now; it was a very serious charge.” “how so?” “you know that when he left here he was taken to the palais de justice.” “well?” “i made my report to the authorities at paris, and a week after he was carried off.” “carried off!” said morrel.
Perplexity: 74537712.0000

Sentence: “what can they have done with him?” “oh, he has been taken to fenestrelles, to pignerol, or to the sainte-marguérite islands.
Perplexity: 133940448.0000

Sentence: but how is it he is not already returned?
Perplexity: 34319196.0000

Sentence: it seems to me the first care of government should be to set at liberty those who have suffered for their adherence to it.” “do not be too hasty, m. morrel,” replied villefort.
Perplexity: 573833856.0000

Sentence: “the order of imprisonment came from high authority, and the order for his liberation must proceed from the same source; and, as napoleon has scarcely been reinstated a fortnight, the letters have not yet been forwarded.” “but,” said morrel, “is there no way of expediting all these formalities—of releasing him from arrest?” “there has been no arrest.” “how?” “it is sometimes essential to government to cause a man’s disappearance without leaving any traces, so that no written forms or documents may defeat their wishes.” “it might be so under the bourbons, but at present——” “it has always been so, my dear morrel, since the reign of louis xiv.
Perplexity: 400625824.0000

Sentence: the emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even louis himself, and the number of prisoners whose names are not on the register is incalculable.” had morrel even any suspicions, so much kindness would have dispelled them.
Perplexity: 103966128.0000

Sentence: “well, m. de villefort, how would you advise me to act?” asked he.
Perplexity: 289474464.0000

Sentence: “petition the minister.” “oh, i know what that is; the minister receives two hundred petitions every day, and does not read three.” “that is true; but he will read a petition countersigned and presented by me.” “and will you undertake to deliver it?” “with the greatest pleasure.
Perplexity: 4502761472.0000

Sentence: dantès was then guilty, and now he is innocent, and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn him.” villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry, which, however improbable it might be, if it did take place would leave him defenceless.
Perplexity: 54719876.0000

Sentence: “but how shall i address the minister?” “sit down there,” said villefort, giving up his place to morrel, “and write what i dictate.” “will you be so good?” “certainly.

Sentence: but lose no time; we have lost too much already.” “that is true.
Perplexity: 54072672.0000

Perplexity: 84052656.0000

Perplexity: 167385808.0000

Sentence: “that will do,” said he; “leave the rest to me.” “will the petition go soon?” “today.” “countersigned by you?” “the best thing i can do will be to certify the truth of the contents of your petition.” and, sitting down, villefort wrote the certificate at the bottom.
Perplexity: 1636950272.0000

Sentence: “what more is to be done?” “i will do whatever is necessary.” this assurance delighted morrel, who took leave of villefort, and hastened to announce to old dantès that he would soon see his son.
Perplexity: 159125584.0000

Sentence: as for villefort, instead of sending to paris, he carefully preserved the petition that so fearfully compromised dantès, in the hopes of an event that seemed not unlikely,—that is, a second restoration.

Perplexity: 666980672.0000

Perplexity: 250281920.0000

Perplexity: 106164592.0000

Sentence: and so dantès, after the hundred days and after waterloo, remained in his dungeon, forgotten of earth and heaven.
Perplexity: 136490512.0000

Sentence: only, during the respite the absence of his rival afforded him, he reflected, partly on the means of deceiving mercédès as to the cause of his absence, partly on plans of emigration and abduction, as from time to time he sat sad and motionless on the summit of cape pharo, at the spot from whence marseilles and the catalans are visible, watching for the apparition of a young and handsome man, who was for him also the messenger of vengeance.
Perplexity: 310763456.0000

Sentence: fernand’s mind was made up; he would shoot dantès, and then kill himself.
Perplexity: 178579680.0000

Perplexity: 179790912.0000

Perplexity: 120106744.0000

Perplexity: 1992148352.0000

Perplexity: 28000468.0000

Perplexity: 31158577152.0000

Sentence: the two prisoners a year after louis xviii.’s restoration, a visit was made by the inspector-general of prisons.
Perplexity: 81929744.0000

Perplexity: 118792384.0000

Perplexity: 24749194.0000

Sentence: the inspector listened attentively; then, turning to the governor, observed, “he will become religious—he is already more gentle; he is afraid, and retreated before the bayonets—madmen are not afraid of anything; i made some curious observations on this at charenton.” then, turning to the prisoner, “what is it you want?” said he.
Perplexity: 801515008.0000

Sentence: “i want to know what crime i have committed—to be tried; and if i am guilty, to be shot; if innocent, to be set at liberty.” “are you well fed?” said the inspector.

Sentence: “i believe so; i don’t know; it’s of no consequence.
Perplexity: 33316322.0000

Sentence: what matters really, not only to me, but to officers of justice and the king, is that an innocent man should languish in prison, the victim of an infamous denunciation, to die here cursing his executioners.” “you are very humble today,” remarked the governor; “you are not so always; the other day, for instance, when you tried to kill the turnkey.” “it is true, sir, and i beg his pardon, for he has always been very good to me, but i was mad.” “and you are not so any longer?” “no; captivity has subdued me—i have been here so long.” “so long?—when were you arrested, then?” asked the inspector.

Perplexity: 22571864.0000

Sentence: i was for twenty years cardinal spada’s secretary; i was arrested, why, i know not, toward the beginning of the year 1811; since then i have demanded my liberty from the italian and french government.” “why from the french government?” “because i was arrested at piombino, and i presume that, like milan and florence, piombino has become the capital of some french department.” “ah,” said the inspector, “you have not the latest news from italy?” “my information dates from the day on which i was arrested,” returned the abbé faria; “and as the emperor had created the kingdom of rome for his infant son, i presume that he has realized the dream of machiavelli and cæsar borgia, which was to make italy a united kingdom.” “monsieur,” returned the inspector, “providence has changed this gigantic plan you advocate so warmly.” “it is the only means of rendering italy strong, happy, and independent.” “very possibly; only i am not come to discuss politics, but to inquire if you have anything to ask or to complain of.” “the food is the same as in other prisons,—that is, very bad; the lodging is very unhealthful, but, on the whole, passable for a dungeon; but it is not that which i wish to speak of, but a secret i have to reveal of the greatest importance.” “we are coming to the point,” whispered the governor.

Sentence: “however,” continued faria, seeing that the inspector was about to depart, “it is not absolutely necessary for us to be alone; the governor can be present.” “unfortunately,” said the governor, “i know beforehand what you are about to say; it concerns your treasures, does it not?” faria fixed his eyes on him with an expression that would have convinced anyone else of his sanity.

Perplexity: 166773952.0000

Sentence: inspector,” continued the governor, “i can tell you the story as well as he, for it has been dinned in my ears for the last four or five years.” “that proves,” returned the abbé, “that you are like those of holy writ, who having eyes see not, and having ears hear not.” “my dear sir, the government is rich and does not want your treasures,” replied the inspector; “keep them until you are liberated.” the abbé’s eyes glistened; he seized the inspector’s hand.

Sentence: i will offer six millions, and i will content myself with the rest, if they will only give me my liberty.” “on my word,” said the inspector in a low tone, “had i not been told beforehand that this man was mad, i should believe what he says.” “i am not mad,” replied faria, with that acuteness of hearing peculiar to prisoners.
Perplexity: 21127600.0000

Sentence: “the treasure i speak of really exists, and i offer to sign an agreement with you, in which i promise to lead you to the spot where you shall dig; and if i deceive you, bring me here again,—i ask no more.” the governor laughed.
Perplexity: 1545948032.0000

Sentence: “is the spot far from here?” “a hundred leagues.” “it is not ill-planned,” said the governor.
Perplexity: 996953600.0000

Sentence: “if all the prisoners took it into their heads to travel a hundred leagues, and their guardians consented to accompany them, they would have a capital chance of escaping.” “the scheme is well known,” said the inspector; “and the abbé’s plan has not even the merit of originality.” then turning to faria, “i inquired if you are well fed?” said he.
Perplexity: 89191928.0000

Sentence: “swear to me,” replied faria, “to free me if what i tell you prove true, and i will stay here while you go to the spot.” “are you well fed?” repeated the inspector.

Perplexity: 167999936.0000

Sentence: as the inquisition rarely allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and their flesh lacerated by torture, so madness is always concealed in its cell, from whence, should it depart, it is conveyed to some gloomy hospital, where the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the mutilated being the jailer delivers to him.
Perplexity: 110795968.0000

Perplexity: 48159972.0000

Sentence: days and weeks passed away, then months—dantès still waited; he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight.
Perplexity: 34741360.0000

Perplexity: 1899185152.0000

Perplexity: 420228800.0000

Sentence: then gloom settled heavily upon him.
Perplexity: 389233440.0000

Perplexity: 96806216.0000

Sentence: but i did so because i was happy, because i had not courted death, because to be cast upon a bed of rocks and seaweed seemed terrible, because i was unwilling that i, a creature made for the service of god, should serve for food to the gulls and ravens.
Perplexity: 914884032.0000

Sentence: but now it is different; i have lost all that bound me to life, death smiles and invites me to repose; i die after my own manner, i die exhausted and broken-spirited, as i fall asleep when i have paced three thousand times round my cell,—that is thirty thousand steps, or about ten leagues.” no sooner had this idea taken possession of him than he became more composed, arranged his couch to the best of his power, ate little and slept less, and found existence almost supportable, because he felt that he could throw it off at pleasure, like a worn-out garment.

Sentence: nothing but the recollection of his oath gave him strength to proceed.
Perplexity: 184641024.0000

Sentence: it was easy to ascertain this; but how could he risk the question?
Perplexity: 328508448.0000

Sentence: it was easy to call his jailer’s attention to the noise, and watch his countenance as he listened; but might he not by this means destroy hopes far more important than the short-lived satisfaction of his own curiosity?

Perplexity: 111451328.0000

Perplexity: 100474936.0000

Sentence: if, on the contrary, it is a prisoner, the noise i make will alarm him, he will cease, and not begin again until he thinks everyone is asleep.” edmond rose again, but this time his legs did not tremble, and his sight was clear; he went to a corner of his dungeon, detached a stone, and with it knocked against the wall where the sound came.

Perplexity: 279240032.0000

Sentence: in the morning the jailer brought him fresh provisions—he had already devoured those of the previous day; he ate these listening anxiously for the sound, walking round and round his cell, shaking the iron bars of the loophole, restoring vigor and agility to his limbs by exercise, and so preparing himself for his future destiny.
Perplexity: 138947552.0000

Perplexity: 143493904.0000

Perplexity: 200278432.0000

Sentence: all his furniture consisted of a bed, a chair, a table, a pail, and a jug.

Perplexity: 120704072.0000

Perplexity: 62901276.0000

Sentence: he returned speedily, advised the prisoner to be more careful, and departed.
Perplexity: 113286352.0000

Sentence: dantès heard joyfully the key grate in the lock; he listened until the sound of steps died away, and then, hastily displacing his bed, saw by the faint light that penetrated into his cell, that he had labored uselessly the previous evening in attacking the stone instead of removing the plaster that surrounded it.
Perplexity: 98169720.0000

Sentence: the damp had rendered it friable, and dantès was able to break it off—in small morsels, it is true, but at the end of half an hour he had scraped off a handful; a mathematician might have calculated that in two years, supposing that the rock was not encountered, a passage twenty feet long and two feet broad, might be formed.

Sentence: the fragments of the jug broke, and after an hour of useless toil, dantès paused with anguish on his brow.
Perplexity: 243854496.0000

Sentence: was he to be thus stopped at the beginning, and was he to wait inactive until his fellow workman had completed his task?
Perplexity: 62649476.0000

Sentence: suddenly an idea occurred to him—he smiled, and the perspiration dried on his forehead.
Perplexity: 51196740.0000

Perplexity: 555379584.0000

Sentence: this time he could not blame dantès.
Perplexity: 437805568.0000

Sentence: he was wrong to leave it there, but the jailer was wrong not to have looked before him.
Perplexity: 277425472.0000

Sentence: the jailer, therefore, only grumbled.
Perplexity: 1241787136.0000

Sentence: then he looked about for something to pour the soup into; dantès’ entire dinner service consisted of one plate—there was no alternative.
Perplexity: 47718516.0000

Sentence: “leave the saucepan,” said dantès; “you can take it away when you bring me my breakfast.” this advice was to the jailer’s taste, as it spared him the necessity of making another trip.
Perplexity: 140859456.0000

Sentence: he left the saucepan.
Perplexity: 117019408.0000

Perplexity: 100083984.0000

Sentence: “well, don’t you intend to bring me another plate?” said dantès.
Perplexity: 910827200.0000

Sentence: “no,” replied the turnkey; “you destroy everything.
Perplexity: 76540440.0000

Sentence: first you break your jug, then you make me break your plate; if all the prisoners followed your example, the government would be ruined.
Perplexity: 188348464.0000

Sentence: i shall leave you the saucepan, and pour your soup into that.
Perplexity: 102947328.0000

Perplexity: 1838602368.0000

Perplexity: 226317104.0000

Sentence: when the hour for his jailer’s visit arrived, dantès straightened the handle of the saucepan as well as he could, and placed it in its accustomed place.
Perplexity: 229902560.0000

Sentence: the turnkey poured his ration of soup into it, together with the fish—for thrice a week the prisoners were deprived of meat.
Perplexity: 58720864.0000

Sentence: this would have been a method of reckoning time, had not dantès long ceased to do so.
Perplexity: 166994528.0000

Sentence: having poured out the soup, the turnkey retired.
Perplexity: 59479260.0000

Sentence: however, he toiled on all the night without being discouraged; but after two or three hours he encountered an obstacle.
Perplexity: 218611440.0000

Perplexity: 94680104.0000

Perplexity: 21138966.0000

Sentence: edmond’s hair stood on end, and he rose to his knees.
Perplexity: 4558307840.0000

Sentence: “ah,” said he, “i hear a human voice.” edmond had not heard anyone speak save his jailer for four or five years; and a jailer is no man to a prisoner—he is a living door, a barrier of flesh and blood adding strength to restraints of oak and iron.
Perplexity: 61297852.0000

Sentence: “in the name of heaven,” cried dantès, “speak again, though the sound of your voice terrifies me.

Perplexity: 254173344.0000

Perplexity: 70103224.0000

Sentence: but how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all this?” “since 1811.” dantès shuddered; this man had been four years longer than himself in prison.
Perplexity: 89859072.0000

Sentence: “do not dig any more,” said the voice; “only tell me how high up is your excavation?” “on a level with the floor.” “how is it concealed?” “behind my bed.” “has your bed been moved since you have been a prisoner?” “no.” “what does your chamber open on?” “a corridor.” “and the corridor?” “on a court.” “alas!” murmured the voice.

Perplexity: 79784936.0000

Perplexity: 19381822.0000

Perplexity: 210115488.0000

Sentence: all i do know is, that i was just nineteen when i was arrested, the 28th of february, 1815.” “not quite twenty-six!” murmured the voice; “at that age he cannot be a traitor.” “oh, no, no,” cried dantès.
Perplexity: 844088768.0000

Sentence: “i swear to you again, rather than betray you, i would allow myself to be hacked in pieces!” “you have done well to speak to me, and ask for my assistance, for i was about to form another plan, and leave you; but your age reassures me.
Perplexity: 233466016.0000

Sentence: i will not forget you.
Perplexity: 222015952.0000

Perplexity: 107667504.0000

Sentence: my father has not yet forgotten me, i am sure, but god alone knows if she loves me still; i shall love you as i loved my father.” “it is well,” returned the voice; “tomorrow.” these few words were uttered with an accent that left no doubt of his sincerity; dantès rose, dispersed the fragments with the same precaution as before, and pushed his bed back against the wall.
Perplexity: 161696816.0000

Sentence: he then gave himself up to his happiness.
Perplexity: 110985696.0000

Sentence: he would no longer be alone.
Perplexity: 326365024.0000

Perplexity: 59445356.0000

Perplexity: 69864816.0000

Perplexity: 616929216.0000

Sentence: he received the enthusiastic greeting of his young acquaintance with evident pleasure, as though his chilled affections were rekindled and invigorated by his contact with one so warm and ardent.
Perplexity: 644662144.0000

Sentence: he thanked him with grateful cordiality for his kindly welcome, although he must at that moment have been suffering bitterly to find another dungeon where he had fondly reckoned on discovering a means of regaining his liberty.
Perplexity: 113936656.0000

Sentence: “let us first see,” said he, “whether it is possible to remove the traces of my entrance here—our future tranquillity depends upon our jailers being entirely ignorant of it.” advancing to the opening, he stooped and raised the stone easily in spite of its weight; then, fitting it into its place, he said: “you removed this stone very carelessly; but i suppose you had no tools to aid you.” “why,” exclaimed dantès, with astonishment, “do you possess any?” “i made myself some; and with the exception of a file, i have all that are necessary,—a chisel, pincers, and lever.” 0201m “oh, how i should like to see these products of your industry and patience.” “well, in the first place, here is my chisel.” so saying, he displayed a sharp strong blade, with a handle made of beechwood.
Perplexity: 70020104.0000

Sentence: “and with what did you contrive to make that?” inquired dantès.
Perplexity: 255803600.0000

Sentence: “with one of the clamps of my bedstead; and this very tool has sufficed me to hollow out the road by which i came hither, a distance of about fifty feet.” “fifty feet!” responded dantès, almost terrified.
Perplexity: 393524992.0000

Sentence: “do not speak so loud, young man—don’t speak so loud.
Perplexity: 67537944.0000

Sentence: it frequently occurs in a state prison like this, that persons are stationed outside the doors of the cells purposely to overhear the conversation of the prisoners.” “but they believe i am shut up alone here.” “that makes no difference.” “and you say that you dug your way a distance of fifty feet to get here?” “i do; that is about the distance that separates your chamber from mine; only, unfortunately, i did not curve aright; for want of the necessary geometrical instruments to calculate my scale of proportion, instead of taking an ellipsis of forty feet, i made it fifty.
Perplexity: 171706320.0000

Sentence: i expected, as i told you, to reach the outer wall, pierce through it, and throw myself into the sea; i have, however, kept along the corridor on which your chamber opens, instead of going beneath it.
Perplexity: 63042768.0000

Sentence: my labor is all in vain, for i find that the corridor looks into a courtyard filled with soldiers.” “that’s true,” said dantès; “but the corridor you speak of only bounds _one_ side of my cell; there are three others—do you know anything of their situation?” “this one is built against the solid rock, and it would take ten experienced miners, duly furnished with the requisite tools, as many years to perforate it.
Perplexity: 1782109312.0000

Sentence: this adjoins the lower part of the governor’s apartments, and were we to work our way through, we should only get into some lock-up cellars, where we must necessarily be recaptured.
Perplexity: 58563712.0000

Sentence: the fourth and last side of your cell faces on—faces on—stop a minute, now where does it face?” the wall of which he spoke was the one in which was fixed the loophole by which light was admitted to the chamber.
Perplexity: 945390400.0000

Sentence: this loophole, which gradually diminished in size as it approached the outside, to an opening through which a child could not have passed, was, for better security, furnished with three iron bars, so as to quiet all apprehensions even in the mind of the most suspicious jailer as to the possibility of a prisoner’s escape.

Perplexity: 345783552.0000

Sentence: the young man obeyed, mounted on the table, and, divining the wishes of his companion, placed his back securely against the wall and held out both hands.
Perplexity: 86359120.0000

Sentence: the stranger, whom as yet dantès knew only by the number of his cell, sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a person of his years, and, light and steady on his feet as a cat or a lizard, climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of dantès, and from them to his shoulders; then, bending double, for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect, he managed to slip his head between the upper bars of the window, so as to be able to command a perfect view from top to bottom.
Perplexity: 418460352.0000

Sentence: an instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head, saying, “i thought so!” and sliding from the shoulders of dantès as dextrously as he had ascended, he nimbly leaped from the table to the ground.
Perplexity: 33090614.0000

Sentence: “what was it that you thought?” asked the young man anxiously, in his turn descending from the table.
Perplexity: 202999408.0000

Sentence: the elder prisoner pondered the matter.
Perplexity: 113258256.0000

Perplexity: 19921614.0000

Sentence: this side of your chamber looks out upon a kind of open gallery, where patrols are continually passing, and sentries keep watch day and night.” “are you quite sure of that?” “certain.
Perplexity: 1178536064.0000

Sentence: i saw the soldier’s shape and the top of his musket; that made me draw in my head so quickly, for i was fearful he might also see me.” “well?” inquired dantès.
Perplexity: 62398324.0000

Sentence: “you perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your dungeon?” “then——” pursued the young man eagerly.
Perplexity: 11140892672.0000

Sentence: “then,” answered the elder prisoner, “the will of god be done!” and as the old man slowly pronounced those words, an air of profound resignation spread itself over his careworn countenance.
Perplexity: 111451328.0000

Sentence: dantès gazed on the man who could thus philosophically resign hopes so long and ardently nourished with an astonishment mingled with admiration.
Perplexity: 100474936.0000

Sentence: “tell me, i entreat of you, who and what you are?” said he at length.
Perplexity: 76738808.0000

Sentence: “never have i met with so remarkable a person as yourself.” “willingly,” answered the stranger; “if, indeed, you feel any curiosity respecting one, now, alas, powerless to aid you in any way.” “say not so; you can console and support me by the strength of your own powerful mind.
Perplexity: 150307760.0000

Sentence: pray let me know who you really are?” the stranger smiled a melancholy smile.
Perplexity: 43255788.0000

Sentence: “then listen,” said he.
Perplexity: 390076224.0000

Sentence: “i am the abbé faria, and have been imprisoned as you know in this château d’if since the year 1811; previously to which i had been confined for three years in the fortress of fenestrelle.
Perplexity: 539215168.0000

Sentence: in the year 1811 i was transferred to piedmont in france.
Perplexity: 35005160.0000

Sentence: it was at this period i learned that the destiny which seemed subservient to every wish formed by napoleon, had bestowed on him a son, named king of rome even in his cradle.
Perplexity: 85937160.0000

Sentence: i was very far then from expecting the change you have just informed me of; namely, that four years afterwards, this colossus of power would be overthrown.
Perplexity: 187742320.0000

Sentence: then who reigns in france at this moment—napoleon ii.
Perplexity: 208832992.0000

Sentence: ?” “no, louis xviii.” “the brother of louis xvi.!
Perplexity: 189565568.0000

Sentence: how inscrutable are the ways of providence—for what great and mysterious purpose has it pleased heaven to abase the man once so elevated, and raise up him who was so abased?” dantès’ whole attention was riveted on a man who could thus forget his own misfortunes while occupying himself with the destinies of others.
Perplexity: 757918848.0000

Sentence: “yes, yes,” continued he, “’twill be the same as it was in england.
Perplexity: 194388096.0000

Sentence: after charles i., cromwell; after cromwell, charles ii., and then james ii., and then some son-in-law or relation, some prince of orange, a stadtholder who becomes a king.

Sentence: then new concessions to the people, then a constitution, then liberty.
Perplexity: 22648110.0000

Sentence: ah, my friend!” said the abbé, turning towards dantès, and surveying him with the kindling gaze of a prophet, “you are young, you will see all this come to pass.” “probably, if ever i get out of prison!” “true,” replied faria, “we are prisoners; but i forget this sometimes, and there are even moments when my mental vision transports me beyond these walls, and i fancy myself at liberty.” “but wherefore are you here?” “because in 1807 i dreamed of the very plan napoleon tried to realize in 1811; because, like machiavelli, i desired to alter the political face of italy, and instead of allowing it to be split up into a quantity of petty principalities, each held by some weak or tyrannical ruler, i sought to form one large, compact, and powerful empire; and, lastly, because i fancied i had found my cæsar borgia in a crowned simpleton, who feigned to enter into my views only to betray me.
Perplexity: 2667879424.0000

Sentence: it was the plan of alexander vi.
Perplexity: 104043288.0000

Sentence: and clement vii., but it will never succeed now, for they attempted it fruitlessly, and napoleon was unable to complete his work.
Perplexity: 347838784.0000

Sentence: italy seems fated to misfortune.” and the old man bowed his head.
Perplexity: 109263144.0000

Sentence: dantès could not understand a man risking his life for such matters.
Perplexity: 39928912.0000

Sentence: napoleon certainly he knew something of, inasmuch as he had seen and spoken with him; but of clement vii.
Perplexity: 801120640.0000

Sentence: and alexander vi.
Perplexity: 88266208.0000

Sentence: he knew nothing.
Perplexity: 20298110.0000

Sentence: “are you not,” he asked, “the priest who here in the château d’if is generally thought to be—ill?” “mad, you mean, don’t you?” “i did not like to say so,” answered dantès, smiling.
Perplexity: 768358080.0000

Sentence: “well, then,” resumed faria with a bitter smile, “let me answer your question in full, by acknowledging that i am the poor mad prisoner of the château d’if, for many years permitted to amuse the different visitors with what is said to be my insanity; and, in all probability, i should be promoted to the honor of making sport for the children, if such innocent beings could be found in an abode devoted like this to suffering and despair.” dantès remained for a short time mute and motionless; at length he said: “then you abandon all hope of escape?” “i perceive its utter impossibility; and i consider it impious to attempt that which the almighty evidently does not approve.” “nay, be not discouraged.
Perplexity: 102739792.0000

Sentence: would it not be expecting too much to hope to succeed at your first attempt?
Perplexity: 31863382.0000

Sentence: why not try to find an opening in another direction from that which has so unfortunately failed?” “alas, it shows how little notion you can have of all it has cost me to effect a purpose so unexpectedly frustrated, that you talk of beginning over again.
Perplexity: 581594496.0000

Sentence: in the first place, i was four years making the tools i possess, and have been two years scraping and digging out earth, hard as granite itself; then what toil and fatigue has it not been to remove huge stones i should once have deemed impossible to loosen.
Perplexity: 60202316.0000

Sentence: whole days have i passed in these titanic efforts, considering my labor well repaid if, by night-time i had contrived to carry away a square inch of this hard-bound cement, changed by ages into a substance unyielding as the stones themselves; then to conceal the mass of earth and rubbish i dug up, i was compelled to break through a staircase, and throw the fruits of my labor into the hollow part of it; but the well is now so completely choked up, that i scarcely think it would be possible to add another handful of dust without leading to discovery.
Perplexity: 26436590.0000

Sentence: consider also that i fully believed i had accomplished the end and aim of my undertaking, for which i had so exactly husbanded my strength as to make it just hold out to the termination of my enterprise; and now, at the moment when i reckoned upon success, my hopes are forever dashed from me.
Perplexity: 194363248.0000

Sentence: no, i repeat again, that nothing shall induce me to renew attempts evidently at variance with the almighty’s pleasure.” dantès held down his head, that the other might not see how joy at the thought of having a companion outweighed the sympathy he felt for the failure of the abbé’s plans.
Perplexity: 95989312.0000

Sentence: the abbé sank upon edmond’s bed, while edmond himself remained standing.
Perplexity: 29883020.0000

Sentence: escape had never once occurred to him.
Perplexity: 12126377984.0000

Sentence: there are, indeed, some things which appear so impossible that the mind does not dwell on them for an instant.
Perplexity: 149506032.0000

Sentence: to undermine the ground for fifty feet—to devote three years to a labor which, if successful, would conduct you to a precipice overhanging the sea—to plunge into the waves from the height of fifty, sixty, perhaps a hundred feet, at the risk of being dashed to pieces against the rocks, should you have been fortunate enough to have escaped the fire of the sentinels; and even, supposing all these perils past, then to have to swim for your life a distance of at least three miles ere you could reach the shore—were difficulties so startling and formidable that dantès had never even dreamed of such a scheme, resigning himself rather to death.
Perplexity: 90631760.0000

Sentence: but the sight of an old man clinging to life with so desperate a courage, gave a fresh turn to his ideas, and inspired him with new courage.
Perplexity: 69473072.0000

Sentence: another, older and less strong than he, had attempted what he had not had sufficient resolution to undertake, and had failed only because of an error in calculation.
Perplexity: 292765536.0000

Sentence: this same person, with almost incredible patience and perseverance, had contrived to provide himself with tools requisite for so unparalleled an attempt.
Perplexity: 1155276032.0000

Sentence: another had done all this; why, then, was it impossible to dantès?
Perplexity: 169975712.0000

Sentence: faria had dug his way through fifty feet, dantès would dig a hundred; faria, at the age of fifty, had devoted three years to the task; he, who was but half as old, would sacrifice six; faria, a priest and savant, had not shrunk from the idea of risking his life by trying to swim a distance of three miles to one of the islands—daume, rattonneau, or lemaire; should a hardy sailor, an experienced diver, like himself, shrink from a similar task; should he, who had so often for mere amusement’s sake plunged to the bottom of the sea to fetch up the bright coral branch, hesitate to entertain the same project?
Perplexity: 181952560.0000

Sentence: he could do it in an hour, and how many times had he, for pure pastime, continued in the water for more than twice as long!
Perplexity: 239005696.0000

Sentence: at once dantès resolved to follow the brave example of his energetic companion, and to remember that what has once been done may be done again.
Perplexity: 42681448.0000

Sentence: after continuing some time in profound meditation, the young man suddenly exclaimed, “i have found what you were in search of!” faria started: “have you, indeed?” cried he, raising his head with quick anxiety; “pray, let me know what it is you have discovered?” “the corridor through which you have bored your way from the cell you occupy here, extends in the same direction as the outer gallery, does it not?” 0207m “it does.” “and is not above fifteen feet from it?” “about that.” “well, then, i will tell you what we must do.
Perplexity: 1435643392.0000

Sentence: we must pierce through the corridor by forming a side opening about the middle, as it were the top part of a cross.
Perplexity: 286583168.0000

Sentence: this time you will lay your plans more accurately; we shall get out into the gallery you have described; kill the sentinel who guards it, and make our escape.
Perplexity: 107395336.0000

Sentence: all we require to insure success is courage, and that you possess, and strength, which i am not deficient in; as for patience, you have abundantly proved yours—you shall now see me prove mine.” “one instant, my dear friend,” replied the abbé; “it is clear you do not understand the nature of the courage with which i am endowed, and what use i intend making of my strength.
Perplexity: 79784936.0000

Sentence: as for patience, i consider that i have abundantly exercised that in beginning every morning the task of the night before, and every night renewing the task of the day.
Perplexity: 19381822.0000

Sentence: but then, young man (and i pray of you to give me your full attention), then i thought i could not be doing anything displeasing to the almighty in trying to set an innocent being at liberty—one who had committed no offence, and merited not condemnation.” “and have your notions changed?” asked dantès with much surprise; “do you think yourself more guilty in making the attempt since you have encountered me?” “no; neither do i wish to incur guilt.
Perplexity: 98565416.0000

Sentence: hitherto i have fancied myself merely waging war against circumstances, not men.
Perplexity: 336059008.0000

Sentence: i have thought it no sin to bore through a wall, or destroy a staircase; but i cannot so easily persuade myself to pierce a heart or take away a life.” a slight movement of surprise escaped dantès.
Perplexity: 134594784.0000

Sentence: “is it possible,” said he, “that where your liberty is at stake you can allow any such scruple to deter you from obtaining it?” “tell me,” replied faria, “what has hindered you from knocking down your jailer with a piece of wood torn from your bedstead, dressing yourself in his clothes, and endeavoring to escape?” “simply the fact that the idea never occurred to me,” answered dantès.
Perplexity: 25959154.0000

Sentence: “because,” said the old man, “the natural repugnance to the commission of such a crime prevented you from thinking of it; and so it ever is because in simple and allowable things our natural instincts keep us from deviating from the strict line of duty.
Perplexity: 855417792.0000

Sentence: the tiger, whose nature teaches him to delight in shedding blood, needs but the sense of smell to show him when his prey is within his reach, and by following this instinct he is enabled to measure the leap necessary to permit him to spring on his victim; but man, on the contrary, loathes the idea of blood—it is not alone that the laws of social life inspire him with a shrinking dread of taking life; his natural construction and physiological formation——” dantès was confused and silent at this explanation of the thoughts which had unconsciously been working in his mind, or rather soul; for there are two distinct sorts of ideas, those that proceed from the head and those that emanate from the heart.
Perplexity: 142708112.0000

Sentence: 0209m “since my imprisonment,” said faria, “i have thought over all the most celebrated cases of escape on record.
Perplexity: 25205144.0000

Sentence: they have rarely been successful.
Perplexity: 133118320.0000

Sentence: those that have been crowned with full success have been long meditated upon, and carefully arranged; such, for instance, as the escape of the duc de beaufort from the château de vincennes, that of the abbé dubuquoi from for l’evêque; of latude from the bastille.
Perplexity: 250900400.0000

Sentence: then there are those for which chance sometimes affords opportunity, and those are the best of all.
Perplexity: 84734192.0000

Sentence: let us, therefore, wait patiently for some favorable moment, and when it presents itself, profit by it.” “ah,” said dantès, “you might well endure the tedious delay; you were constantly employed in the task you set yourself, and when weary with toil, you had your hopes to refresh and encourage you.” “i assure you,” replied the old man, “i did not turn to that source for recreation or support.” “what did you do then?” “i wrote or studied.” “were you then permitted the use of pens, ink, and paper?” “oh, no,” answered the abbé; “i had none but what i made for myself.” “you made paper, pens and ink?” “yes.” dantès gazed with admiration, but he had some difficulty in believing.
Perplexity: 75285128.0000

Sentence: faria saw this.
Perplexity: 87350768.0000

Sentence: “when you pay me a visit in my cell, my young friend,” said he, “i will show you an entire work, the fruits of the thoughts and reflections of my whole life; many of them meditated over in the shades of the colosseum at rome, at the foot of st. mark’s column at venice, and on the borders of the arno at florence, little imagining at the time that they would be arranged in order within the walls of the château d’if.
Perplexity: 36802760.0000

Sentence: the work i speak of is called _a treatise on the possibility of a general monarchy in italy_, and will make one large quarto volume.” “and on what have you written all this?” “on two of my shirts.
Perplexity: 899623616.0000

Sentence: i invented a preparation that makes linen as smooth and as easy to write on as parchment.” “you are, then, a chemist?” “somewhat; i know lavoisier, and was the intimate friend of cabanis.” “but for such a work you must have needed books—had you any?” “i had nearly five thousand volumes in my library at rome; but after reading them over many times, i found out that with one hundred and fifty well-chosen books a man possesses, if not a complete summary of all human knowledge, at least all that a man need really know.
Perplexity: 331393280.0000

Sentence: i devoted three years of my life to reading and studying these one hundred and fifty volumes, till i knew them nearly by heart; so that since i have been in prison, a very slight effort of memory has enabled me to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open before me.
Perplexity: 118872848.0000

Sentence: i could recite you the whole of thucydides, xenophon, plutarch, titus livius, tacitus, strada, jornandes, dante, montaigne, shakespeare, spinoza, machiavelli, and bossuet.
Perplexity: 91993880.0000

Sentence: i name only the most important.” “you are, doubtless, acquainted with a variety of languages, so as to have been able to read all these?” “yes, i speak five of the modern tongues—that is to say, german, french, italian, english, and spanish; by the aid of ancient greek i learned modern greek—i don’t speak it so well as i could wish, but i am still trying to improve myself.” “improve yourself!” repeated dantès; “why, how can you manage to do so?” “why, i made a vocabulary of the words i knew; turned, returned, and arranged them, so as to enable me to express my thoughts through their medium.
Perplexity: 26556516.0000

Sentence: i know nearly one thousand words, which is all that is absolutely necessary, although i believe there are nearly one hundred thousand in the dictionaries.
Perplexity: 237415920.0000

Sentence: i cannot hope to be very fluent, but i certainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes; and that would be quite as much as i should ever require.” stronger grew the wonder of dantès, who almost fancied he had to do with one gifted with supernatural powers; still hoping to find some imperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings, he added, “then if you were not furnished with pens, how did you manage to write the work you speak of?” “i made myself some excellent ones, which would be universally preferred to all others if once known.
Perplexity: 222163360.0000

Sentence: you are aware what huge whitings are served to us on _maigre_ days.
Perplexity: 58875296.0000

Sentence: well, i selected the cartilages of the heads of these fishes, and you can scarcely imagine the delight with which i welcomed the arrival of each wednesday, friday, and saturday, as affording me the means of increasing my stock of pens; for i will freely confess that my historical labors have been my greatest solace and relief.
Perplexity: 406903712.0000

Sentence: while retracing the past, i forget the present; and traversing at will the path of history i cease to remember that i am myself a prisoner.” “but the ink,” said dantès; “of what did you make your ink?” “there was formerly a fireplace in my dungeon,” replied faria, “but it was closed up long ere i became an occupant of this prison.
Perplexity: 132259360.0000

Sentence: still, it must have been many years in use, for it was thickly covered with a coating of soot; this soot i dissolved in a portion of the wine brought to me every sunday, and i assure you a better ink cannot be desired.
Perplexity: 80570968.0000

Sentence: for very important notes, for which closer attention is required, i pricked one of my fingers, and wrote with my own blood.” “and when,” asked dantès, “may i see all this?” “whenever you please,” replied the abbé.
Perplexity: 97086352.0000

Sentence: “oh, then let it be directly!” exclaimed the young man.
Perplexity: 122138312.0000

Sentence: “follow me, then,” said the abbé, as he re-entered the subterranean passage, in which he soon disappeared, followed by dantès.
Perplexity: 521090368.0000

Sentence: the abbé’s chamber after having passed with tolerable ease through the subterranean passage, which, however, did not admit of their holding themselves erect, the two friends reached the further end of the corridor, into which the abbé’s cell opened; from that point the passage became much narrower, and barely permitted one to creep through on hands and knees.
Perplexity: 80993144.0000

Sentence: the floor of the abbé’s cell was paved, and it had been by raising one of the stones in the most obscure corner that faria had been able to commence the laborious task of which dantès had witnessed the completion.
Perplexity: 26095276.0000

Sentence: as he entered the chamber of his friend, dantès cast around one eager and searching glance in quest of the expected marvels, but nothing more than common met his view.
Perplexity: 222101088.0000

Sentence: “it is well,” said the abbé; “we have some hours before us—it is now just a quarter past twelve o’clock.” instinctively dantès turned round to observe by what watch or clock the abbé had been able so accurately to specify the hour.
Perplexity: 252253104.0000

Sentence: “look at this ray of light which enters by my window,” said the abbé, “and then observe the lines traced on the wall.
Perplexity: 89932968.0000

Sentence: well, by means of these lines, which are in accordance with the double motion of the earth, and the ellipse it describes round the sun, i am enabled to ascertain the precise hour with more minuteness than if i possessed a watch; for that might be broken or deranged in its movements, while the sun and earth never vary in their appointed paths.” this last explanation was wholly lost upon dantès, who had always imagined, from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in the mediterranean, that it moved, and not the earth.
Perplexity: 871561024.0000

Sentence: a double movement of the globe he inhabited, and of which he could feel nothing, appeared to him perfectly impossible.
Perplexity: 223749136.0000

Sentence: each word that fell from his companion’s lips seemed fraught with the mysteries of science, as worthy of digging out as the gold and diamonds in the mines of guzerat and golconda, which he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in his earliest youth.
Perplexity: 19859736.0000

Sentence: “come,” said he to the abbé, “i am anxious to see your treasures.” the abbé smiled, and, proceeding to the disused fireplace, raised, by the help of his chisel, a long stone, which had doubtless been the hearth, beneath which was a cavity of considerable depth, serving as a safe depository of the articles mentioned to dantès.
Perplexity: 373865440.0000

Sentence: 0213m “what do you wish to see first?” asked the abbé.
Perplexity: 99824328.0000

Sentence: “oh, your great work on the monarchy of italy!” faria then drew forth from his hiding-place three or four rolls of linen, laid one over the other, like folds of papyrus.
Perplexity: 128800184.0000

Sentence: these rolls consisted of slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long; they were all carefully numbered and closely covered with writing, so legible that dantès could easily read it, as well as make out the sense—it being in italian, a language he, as a provençal, perfectly understood.
Perplexity: 262063168.0000

Sentence: “there,” said he, “there is the work complete.
Perplexity: 75708912.0000

Sentence: i wrote the word _finis_ at the end of the sixty-eighth strip about a week ago.
Perplexity: 541042752.0000

Sentence: i have torn up two of my shirts, and as many handkerchiefs as i was master of, to complete the precious pages.
Perplexity: 1076464000.0000

Sentence: should i ever get out of prison and find in all italy a printer courageous enough to publish what i have composed, my literary reputation is forever secured.” “i see,” answered dantès.
Perplexity: 126621824.0000

Sentence: “now let me behold the curious pens with which you have written your work.” “look!” said faria, showing to the young man a slender stick about six inches long, and much resembling the size of the handle of a fine painting-brush, to the end of which was tied, by a piece of thread, one of those cartilages of which the abbé had before spoken to dantès; it was pointed, and divided at the nib like an ordinary pen.
Perplexity: 28214750.0000

Sentence: dantès examined it with intense admiration, then looked around to see the instrument with which it had been shaped so correctly into form.
Perplexity: 892634560.0000

Sentence: “ah, yes,” said faria; “the penknife.
Perplexity: 142708112.0000

Sentence: that’s my masterpiece.
Perplexity: 25205144.0000

Sentence: i made it, as well as this larger knife, out of an old iron candlestick.” the penknife was sharp and keen as a razor; as for the other knife, it would serve a double purpose, and with it one could cut and thrust.
Perplexity: 133118320.0000

Sentence: dantès examined the various articles shown to him with the same attention that he had bestowed on the curiosities and strange tools exhibited in the shops at marseilles as the works of the savages in the south seas from whence they had been brought by the different trading vessels.
Perplexity: 250900400.0000

Sentence: “as for the ink,” said faria, “i told you how i managed to obtain that—and i only just make it from time to time, as i require it.” “one thing still puzzles me,” observed dantès, “and that is how you managed to do all this by daylight?” “i worked at night also,” replied faria.
Perplexity: 129988768.0000

Sentence: “night!—why, for heaven’s sake, are your eyes like cats’, that you can see to work in the dark?” “indeed they are not; but god has supplied man with the intelligence that enables him to overcome the limitations of natural conditions.
Perplexity: 196282240.0000

Sentence: i furnished myself with a light.” “you did?
Perplexity: 28906274.0000

Sentence: pray tell me how.” “i separated the fat from the meat served to me, melted it, and so made oil—here is my lamp.” so saying, the abbé exhibited a sort of torch very similar to those used in public illuminations.
Perplexity: 741939264.0000

Sentence: “but how do you procure a light?” “oh, here are two flints and a piece of burnt linen.” “and matches?” “i pretended that i had a disorder of the skin, and asked for a little sulphur, which was readily supplied.” dantès laid the different things he had been looking at on the table, and stood with his head drooping on his breast, as though overwhelmed by the perseverance and strength of faria’s mind.
Perplexity: 163366800.0000

Sentence: 0215m “you have not seen all yet,” continued faria, “for i did not think it wise to trust all my treasures in the same hiding-place.
Perplexity: 35194556.0000

Sentence: let us shut this one up.” they put the stone back in its place; the abbé sprinkled a little dust over it to conceal the traces of its having been removed, rubbed his foot well on it to make it assume the same appearance as the other, and then, going towards his bed, he removed it from the spot it stood in.
Perplexity: 189972768.0000

Sentence: behind the head of the bed, and concealed by a stone fitting in so closely as to defy all suspicion, was a hollow space, and in this space a ladder of cords between twenty-five and thirty feet in length.
Perplexity: 536805696.0000

Sentence: dantès closely and eagerly examined it; he found it firm, solid, and compact enough to bear any weight.
Perplexity: 1350507776.0000

Sentence: “who supplied you with the materials for making this wonderful work?” “i tore up several of my shirts, and ripped out the seams in the sheets of my bed, during my three years’ imprisonment at fenestrelle; and when i was removed to the château d’if, i managed to bring the ravellings with me, so that i have been able to finish my work here.” “and was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed?” “oh, no, for when i had taken out the thread i required, i hemmed the edges over again.” “with what?” “with this needle,” said the abbé, as, opening his ragged vestments, he showed dantès a long, sharp fish-bone, with a small perforated eye for the thread, a small portion of which still remained in it.
Perplexity: 28077534.0000

Sentence: “i once thought,” continued faria, “of removing these iron bars, and letting myself down from the window, which, as you see, is somewhat wider than yours, although i should have enlarged it still more preparatory to my flight; however, i discovered that i should merely have dropped into a sort of inner court, and i therefore renounced the project altogether as too full of risk and danger.
Perplexity: 1421743104.0000

Sentence: nevertheless, i carefully preserved my ladder against one of those unforeseen opportunities of which i spoke just now, and which sudden chance frequently brings about.” while affecting to be deeply engaged in examining the ladder, the mind of dantès was, in fact, busily occupied by the idea that a person so intelligent, ingenious, and clear-sighted as the abbé might probably be able to solve the dark mystery of his own misfortunes, where he himself could see nothing.
Perplexity: 32287100.0000

Sentence: “what are you thinking of?” asked the abbé smilingly, imputing the deep abstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe and wonder.
Perplexity: 180792640.0000

Sentence: “i was reflecting, in the first place,” replied dantès, “upon the enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to reach the high perfection to which you have attained.
Perplexity: 323192029184.0000

Sentence: what would you not have accomplished if you had been free?” “possibly nothing at all; the overflow of my brain would probably, in a state of freedom, have evaporated in a thousand follies; misfortune is needed to bring to light the treasures of the human intellect.
Perplexity: 27644498.0000

Sentence: compression is needed to explode gunpowder.
Perplexity: 93793800.0000

Sentence: captivity has brought my mental faculties to a focus; and you are well aware that from the collision of clouds electricity is produced—from electricity, lightning, from lightning, illumination.” “no,” replied dantès.
Perplexity: 386491808.0000

Sentence: “i know nothing.
Perplexity: 51378688.0000

Sentence: some of your words are to me quite empty of meaning.
Perplexity: 41768904.0000

Sentence: you must be blessed indeed to possess the knowledge you have.” the abbé smiled.
Perplexity: 279204864.0000

Sentence: “well,” said he, “but you had another subject for your thoughts; did you not say so just now?” “i did!” “you have told me as yet but one of them—let me hear the other.” “it was this,—that while you had related to me all the particulars of your past life, you were perfectly unacquainted with mine.” “your life, my young friend, has not been of sufficient length to admit of your having passed through any very important events.” “it has been long enough to inflict on me a great and undeserved misfortune.
Perplexity: 165618512.0000

Sentence: i would fain fix the source of it on man that i may no longer vent reproaches upon heaven.” “then you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged?” “i do, indeed; and this i swear by the two beings most dear to me upon earth,—my father and mercédès.” “come,” said the abbé, closing his hiding-place, and pushing the bed back to its original situation, “let me hear your story.” dantès obeyed, and commenced what he called his history, but which consisted only of the account of a voyage to india, and two or three voyages to the levant, until he arrived at the recital of his last cruise, with the death of captain leclere, and the receipt of a packet to be delivered by himself to the grand marshal; his interview with that personage, and his receiving, in place of the packet brought, a letter addressed to a monsieur noirtier—his arrival at marseilles, and interview with his father—his affection for mercédès, and their nuptual feast—his arrest and subsequent examination, his temporary detention at the palais de justice, and his final imprisonment in the château d’if.
Perplexity: 109224184.0000

Sentence: from this point everything was a blank to dantès—he knew nothing more, not even the length of time he had been imprisoned.
Perplexity: 38982016.0000

Sentence: his recital finished, the abbé reflected long and earnestly.
Perplexity: 1997665408.0000

Sentence: “there is,” said he, at the end of his meditations, “a clever maxim, which bears upon what i was saying to you some little while ago, and that is, that unless wicked ideas take root in a naturally depraved mind, human nature, in a right and wholesome state, revolts at crime.
Perplexity: 564143808.0000

Sentence: still, from an artificial civilization have originated wants, vices, and false tastes, which occasionally become so powerful as to stifle within us all good feelings, and ultimately to lead us into guilt and wickedness.
Perplexity: 72537288.0000

Sentence: from this view of things, then, comes the axiom that if you visit to discover the author of any bad action, seek first to discover the person to whom the perpetration of that bad action could be in any way advantageous.
Perplexity: 92978728.0000

Sentence: now, to apply it in your case,—to whom could your disappearance have been serviceable?” “to no one, by heaven!
Perplexity: 37916728.0000

Sentence: i was a very insignificant person.” “do not speak thus, for your reply evinces neither logic nor philosophy; everything is relative, my dear young friend, from the king who stands in the way of his successor, to the employee who keeps his rival out of a place.
Perplexity: 26119676.0000

Sentence: now, in the event of the king’s death, his successor inherits a crown,—when the employee dies, the supernumerary steps into his shoes, and receives his salary of twelve thousand livres.
Perplexity: 122109416.0000

Sentence: well, these twelve thousand livres are his civil list, and are as essential to him as the twelve millions of a king.
Perplexity: 62672184.0000

Sentence: everyone, from the highest to the lowest degree, has his place on the social ladder, and is beset by stormy passions and conflicting interests, as in descartes’ theory of pressure and impulsion.
Perplexity: 75801680.0000

Sentence: but these forces increase as we go higher, so that we have a spiral which in defiance of reason rests upon the apex and not on the base.
Perplexity: 42009236.0000

Sentence: now let us return to your particular world.
Perplexity: 254177712.0000

Sentence: you say you were on the point of being made captain of the _pharaon_?” “yes.” “and about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl?” “yes.” “now, could anyone have had any interest in preventing the accomplishment of these two things?
Perplexity: 177542480.0000

Sentence: but let us first settle the question as to its being the interest of anyone to hinder you from being captain of the _pharaon_.
Perplexity: 302145312.0000

Sentence: what say you?” “i cannot believe such was the case.
Perplexity: 48114593792.0000

Sentence: i was generally liked on board, and had the sailors possessed the right of selecting a captain themselves, i feel convinced their choice would have fallen on me.
Perplexity: 62156244.0000

Sentence: there was only one person among the crew who had any feeling of ill-will towards me.
Perplexity: 110149512.0000

Sentence: i had quarelled with him some time previously, and had even challenged him to fight me; but he refused.” “now we are getting on.
Perplexity: 3472509952.0000

Sentence: and what was this man’s name?” “danglars.” “what rank did he hold on board?” “he was supercargo.” “and had you been captain, should you have retained him in his employment?” “not if the choice had remained with me, for i had frequently observed inaccuracies in his accounts.” “good again!
Perplexity: 88058704.0000

Sentence: now then, tell me, was any person present during your last conversation with captain leclere?” “no; we were quite alone.” “could your conversation have been overheard by anyone?” “it might, for the cabin door was open—and—stay; now i recollect,—danglars himself passed by just as captain leclere was giving me the packet for the grand marshal.” “that’s better,” cried the abbé; “now we are on the right scent.
Perplexity: 284901280.0000

Sentence: did you take anybody with you when you put into the port of elba?” “nobody.” “somebody there received your packet, and gave you a letter in place of it, i think?” “yes; the grand marshal did.” “and what did you do with that letter?” “put it into my portfolio.” “you had your portfolio with you, then?
Perplexity: 253165520.0000

Sentence: now, how could a sailor find room in his pocket for a portfolio large enough to contain an official letter?” “you are right; it was left on board.” “then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter in the portfolio?” “no.” “and what did you do with this same letter while returning from porto-ferrajo to the vessel?” “i carried it in my hand.” “so that when you went on board the _pharaon_, everybody could see that you held a letter in your hand?” “yes.” “danglars, as well as the rest?” “danglars, as well as others.” “now, listen to me, and try to recall every circumstance attending your arrest.
Perplexity: 642019008.0000

Sentence: do you recollect the words in which the information against you was formulated?” “oh yes, i read it over three times, and the words sank deeply into my memory.” “repeat it to me.” dantès paused a moment, then said, “this is it, word for word: ‘the king’s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion, that one edmond dantès, mate on board the _pharaon_, this day arrived from smyrna, after having touched at naples and porto-ferrajo, has been intrusted by murat with a packet for the usurper; again, by the usurper, with a letter for the bonapartist club in paris.
Perplexity: 52478956.0000

Sentence: this proof of his guilt may be procured by his immediate arrest, as the letter will be found either about his person, at his father’s residence, or in his cabin on board the _pharaon_.’” the abbé shrugged his shoulders.
Perplexity: 2713471488.0000

Sentence: “the thing is clear as day,” said he; “and you must have had a very confiding nature, as well as a good heart, not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair.” “do you really think so?
Perplexity: 37304472.0000

Sentence: ah, that would indeed be infamous.” “how did danglars usually write?” “in a handsome, running hand.” “and how was the anonymous letter written?” “backhanded.” again the abbé smiled.
Perplexity: 370659680.0000

Sentence: “disguised.” “it was very boldly written, if disguised.” “stop a bit,” said the abbé, taking up what he called his pen, and, after dipping it into the ink, he wrote on a piece of prepared linen, with his left hand, the first two or three words of the accusation.
Perplexity: 187786368.0000

Sentence: dantès drew back, and gazed on the abbé with a sensation almost amounting to terror.
Perplexity: 186678944.0000

Sentence: “how very astonishing!” cried he at length.
Perplexity: 79447960.0000

Sentence: “why your writing exactly resembles that of the accusation.” “simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand; and i have noticed that——” “what?” “that while the writing of different persons done with the right hand varies, that performed with the left hand is invariably uniform.” “you have evidently seen and observed everything.” “let us proceed.” “oh, yes, yes!” “now as regards the second question.” “i am listening.” “was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage with mercédès?” “yes; a young man who loved her.” “and his name was——” “fernand.” “that is a spanish name, i think?” “he was a catalan.” “you imagine him capable of writing the letter?” “oh, no; he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife into me.” “that is in strict accordance with the spanish character; an assassination they will unhesitatingly commit, but an act of cowardice, never.” “besides,” said dantès, “the various circumstances mentioned in the letter were wholly unknown to him.” “you had never spoken of them yourself to anyone?” “to no one.” “not even to your mistress?” “no, not even to my betrothed.” “then it is danglars.” “i feel quite sure of it now.” “wait a little.
Perplexity: 50939588.0000

Sentence: pray, was danglars acquainted with fernand?” “no—yes, he was.
Perplexity: 849049088.0000

Sentence: now i recollect——” “what?” “to have seen them both sitting at table together under an arbor at père pamphile’s the evening before the day fixed for my wedding.
Perplexity: 93777880.0000

Sentence: they were in earnest conversation.
Perplexity: 25865446.0000

Sentence: danglars was joking in a friendly way, but fernand looked pale and agitated.” “were they alone?” “there was a third person with them whom i knew perfectly well, and who had, in all probability made their acquaintance; he was a tailor named caderousse, but he was very drunk.
Perplexity: 1942421632.0000

Sentence: stay!—stay!—how strange that it should not have occurred to me before!
Perplexity: 253042432.0000

Sentence: now i remember quite well, that on the table round which they were sitting were pens, ink, and paper.
Perplexity: 184679408.0000

Sentence: oh, the heartless, treacherous scoundrels!” exclaimed dantès, pressing his hand to his throbbing brows.
Perplexity: 49254396.0000

Sentence: “is there anything else i can assist you in discovering, besides the villany of your friends?” inquired the abbé with a laugh.
Perplexity: 1005829376.0000

Sentence: “yes, yes,” replied dantès eagerly; “i would beg of you, who see so completely to the depths of things, and to whom the greatest mystery seems but an easy riddle, to explain to me how it was that i underwent no second examination, was never brought to trial, and, above all, was condemned without ever having had sentence passed on me?” “that is altogether a different and more serious matter,” responded the abbé.
Perplexity: 402764960.0000

Sentence: “the ways of justice are frequently too dark and mysterious to be easily penetrated.
Perplexity: 30224606.0000

Sentence: all we have hitherto done in the matter has been child’s play.
Perplexity: 747188032.0000

Sentence: if you wish me to enter upon the more difficult part of the business, you must assist me by the most minute information on every point.” “pray ask me whatever questions you please; for, in good truth, you see more clearly into my life than i do myself.” “in the first place, then, who examined you,—the king’s attorney, his deputy, or a magistrate?” “the deputy.” “was he young or old?” “about six or seven-and-twenty years of age, i should say.” “so,” answered the abbé.
Perplexity: 273559744.0000

Sentence: “old enough to be ambitious, but too young to be corrupt.
Perplexity: 469290272.0000

Sentence: and how did he treat you?” “with more of mildness than severity.” “did you tell him your whole story?” “i did.” “and did his conduct change at all in the course of your examination?” “he did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had brought me into this scrape.
Perplexity: 88411288.0000

Sentence: he seemed quite overcome by my misfortune.” “by your misfortune?” “yes.” “then you feel quite sure that it was your misfortune he deplored?” “he gave me one great proof of his sympathy, at any rate.” “and that?” “he burnt the sole evidence that could at all have criminated me.” “what?
Perplexity: 100868568.0000

Sentence: the accusation?” “no; the letter.” “are you sure?” “i saw it done.” “that alters the case.
Perplexity: 340287648.0000

Sentence: this man might, after all, be a greater scoundrel than you have thought possible.” “upon my word,” said dantès, “you make me shudder.
Perplexity: 48665712.0000

Sentence: is the world filled with tigers and crocodiles?” “yes; and remember that two-legged tigers and crocodiles are more dangerous than the others.” “never mind; let us go on.” “with all my heart!
Perplexity: 30980986.0000

Sentence: you tell me he burned the letter?” “he did; saying at the same time, ‘you see i thus destroy the only proof existing against you.’” “this action is somewhat too sublime to be natural.” “you think so?” “i am sure of it.
Perplexity: 410186624.0000

Sentence: to whom was this letter addressed?” “to m. noirtier, rue coq-héron, no.
Perplexity: 27713234.0000

Sentence: 13, paris.” “now can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could possibly have had in the destruction of that letter?” “why, it is not altogether impossible he might have had, for he made me promise several times never to speak of that letter to anyone, assuring me he so advised me for my own interest; and, more than this, he insisted on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the name mentioned in the address.” “noirtier!” repeated the abbé; “noirtier!—i knew a person of that name at the court of the queen of etruria,—a noirtier, who had been a girondin during the revolution!
Perplexity: 464251264.0000

Sentence: what was your deputy called?” “de villefort!” the abbé burst into a fit of laughter, while dantès gazed on him in utter astonishment.
Perplexity: 76789176.0000

Sentence: “what ails you?” said he at length.
Perplexity: 236022112.0000

Sentence: “do you see that ray of sunlight?” “i do.” “well, the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you.

Sentence: poor fellow!
Perplexity: 118577104.0000

Sentence: poor young man!
Perplexity: 284900736.0000

Sentence: and you tell me this magistrate expressed great sympathy and commiseration for you?” “he did.” “and the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter?” “yes.” “and then made you swear never to utter the name of noirtier?” “yes.” “why, you poor short-sighted simpleton, can you not guess who this noirtier was, whose very name he was so careful to keep concealed?
Perplexity: 72985136.0000

Sentence: this noirtier was his father!” had a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of dantès, or hell opened its yawning gulf before him, he could not have been more completely transfixed with horror than he was at the sound of these unexpected words.
Perplexity: 21569426.0000

Sentence: starting up, he clasped his hands around his head as though to prevent his very brain from bursting, and exclaimed, “his father!
Perplexity: 20256718848.0000

Sentence: his father!” “yes, his father,” replied the abbé; “his right name was noirtier de villefort.” at this instant a bright light shot through the mind of dantès, and cleared up all that had been dark and obscure before.
Perplexity: 135975504.0000

Sentence: the change that had come over villefort during the examination, the destruction of the letter, the exacted promise, the almost supplicating tones of the magistrate, who seemed rather to implore mercy than to pronounce punishment,—all returned with a stunning force to his memory.
Perplexity: 134930464.0000

Sentence: he cried out, and staggered against the wall like a drunken man, then he hurried to the opening that led from the abbé’s cell to his own, and said, “i must be alone, to think over all this.” when he regained his dungeon, he threw himself on his bed, where the turnkey found him in the evening visit, sitting with fixed gaze and contracted features, dumb and motionless as a statue.
Perplexity: 397004992.0000

Sentence: during these hours of profound meditation, which to him had seemed only minutes, he had formed a fearful resolution, and bound himself to its fulfilment by a solemn oath.
Perplexity: 386211776.0000

Sentence: dantès was at length roused from his reverie by the voice of faria, who, having also been visited by his jailer, had come to invite his fellow-sufferer to share his supper.
Perplexity: 1513489664.0000

Sentence: the reputation of being out of his mind, though harmlessly and even amusingly so, had procured for the abbé unusual privileges.
Perplexity: 31485254.0000

Sentence: he was supplied with bread of a finer, whiter quality than the usual prison fare, and even regaled each sunday with a small quantity of wine.
Perplexity: 771509568.0000

Sentence: now this was a sunday, and the abbé had come to ask his young companion to share the luxuries with him.
Perplexity: 101070784.0000

Sentence: dantès followed him; his features were no longer contracted, and now wore their usual expression, but there was that in his whole appearance that bespoke one who had come to a fixed and desperate resolve.
Perplexity: 56830580.0000

Sentence: faria bent on him his penetrating eye.
Perplexity: 432163904.0000

Sentence: “i regret now,” said he, “having helped you in your late inquiries, or having given you the information i did.” “why so?” inquired dantès.
Perplexity: 29153612.0000

Sentence: “because it has instilled a new passion in your heart—that of vengeance.” dantès smiled.
Perplexity: 143407456.0000

Sentence: “let us talk of something else,” said he.
Perplexity: 53123696.0000

Sentence: again the abbé looked at him, then mournfully shook his head; but in accordance with dantès’ request, he began to speak of other matters.
Perplexity: 758614528.0000

Sentence: the elder prisoner was one of those persons whose conversation, like that of all who have experienced many trials, contained many useful and important hints as well as sound information; but it was never egotistical, for the unfortunate man never alluded to his own sorrows.
Perplexity: 376864576.0000

Sentence: dantès listened with admiring attention to all he said; some of his remarks corresponded with what he already knew, or applied to the sort of knowledge his nautical life had enabled him to acquire.
Perplexity: 126502336.0000

Sentence: a part of the good abbé’s words, however, were wholly incomprehensible to him; but, like the aurora which guides the navigator in northern latitudes, opened new vistas to the inquiring mind of the listener, and gave fantastic glimpses of new horizons, enabling him justly to estimate the delight an intellectual mind would have in following one so richly gifted as faria along the heights of truth, where he was so much at home.
Perplexity: 290134496.0000

Sentence: “you must teach me a small part of what you know,” said dantès, “if only to prevent your growing weary of me.

Perplexity: 252160256.0000

Perplexity: 368500544.0000

Sentence: “alas, my boy,” said he, “human knowledge is confined within very narrow limits; and when i have taught you mathematics, physics, history, and the three or four modern languages with which i am acquainted, you will know as much as i do myself.
Perplexity: 95391944.0000

Sentence: now, it will scarcely require two years for me to communicate to you the stock of learning i possess.” “two years!” exclaimed dantès; “do you really believe i can acquire all these things in so short a time?” “not their application, certainly, but their principles you may; to learn is not to know; there are the learners and the learned.
Perplexity: 57986624.0000

Sentence: memory makes the one, philosophy the other.” “but cannot one learn philosophy?” “philosophy cannot be taught; it is the application of the sciences to truth; it is like the golden cloud in which the messiah went up into heaven.” “well, then,” said dantès, “what shall you teach me first?
Perplexity: 48233052.0000

Sentence: i am in a hurry to begin.

Perplexity: 37597484.0000

Sentence: dantès possessed a prodigious memory, combined with an astonishing quickness and readiness of conception; the mathematical turn of his mind rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation, while his naturally poetical feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality of arithmetical computation, or the rigid severity of geometry.
Perplexity: 66086024.0000

Sentence: he already knew italian, and had also picked up a little of the romaic dialect during voyages to the east; and by the aid of these two languages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others, so that at the end of six months he began to speak spanish, english, and german.
Perplexity: 272727200.0000

Sentence: in strict accordance with the promise made to the abbé, dantès spoke no more of escape.
Perplexity: 1020241536.0000

Sentence: perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no room for such thoughts; perhaps the recollection that he had pledged his word (on which his sense of honor was keen) kept him from referring in any way to the possibilities of flight.
Perplexity: 221757808.0000

Sentence: days, even months, passed by unheeded in one rapid and instructive course.

Perplexity: 193625824.0000

Perplexity: 145839264.0000

Sentence: sometimes he would fall into long reveries, sigh heavily and involuntarily, then suddenly rise, and, with folded arms, begin pacing the confined space of his dungeon.
Perplexity: 1159308928.0000

Sentence: one day he stopped all at once, and exclaimed: “ah, if there were no sentinel!” “there shall not be one a minute longer than you please,” said dantès, who had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though his brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest operations.
Perplexity: 138593680.0000

Sentence: “i have already told you,” answered the abbé, “that i loathe the idea of shedding blood.” “and yet the murder, if you choose to call it so, would be simply a measure of self-preservation.” “no matter!
Perplexity: 106732680.0000

Sentence: i could never agree to it.” “still, you have thought of it?” “incessantly, alas!” cried the abbé.
Perplexity: 27722594.0000

Perplexity: 10465721344.0000

Sentence: “i have; if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in the gallery beyond us.” “he shall be both blind and deaf,” replied the young man, with an air of determination that made his companion shudder.
Perplexity: 41959028.0000

Sentence: “no, no,” cried the abbé; “impossible!” dantès endeavored to renew the subject; the abbé shook his head in token of disapproval, and refused to make any further response.

Perplexity: 823177792.0000

Perplexity: 135930656.0000

Perplexity: 67579952.0000

Perplexity: 105772480.0000

Sentence: it consisted of a plan of his own cell and that of dantès, with the passage which united them.
Perplexity: 1719026944.0000

Sentence: in this passage he proposed to drive a level as they do in mines; this level would bring the two prisoners immediately beneath the gallery where the sentry kept watch; once there, a large excavation would be made, and one of the flag-stones with which the gallery was paved be so completely loosened that at the desired moment it would give way beneath the feet of the soldier, who, stunned by his fall, would be immediately bound and gagged by dantès before he had power to offer any resistance.
Perplexity: 484121568.0000

Sentence: the prisoners were then to make their way through one of the gallery windows, and to let themselves down from the outer walls by means of the abbé’s ladder of cords.
Perplexity: 228473568.0000

Sentence: dantès’ eyes sparkled with joy, and he rubbed his hands with delight at the idea of a plan so simple, yet apparently so certain to succeed.
Perplexity: 34767476.0000

Sentence: that very day the miners began their labors, with a vigor and alacrity proportionate to their long rest from fatigue and their hopes of ultimate success.

Perplexity: 154717440.0000

Sentence: the fresh earth excavated during their present work, and which would have entirely blocked up the old passage, was thrown, by degrees and with the utmost precaution, out of the window in either faria’s or dantès’ cell, the rubbish being first pulverized so finely that the night wind carried it far away without permitting the smallest trace to remain.
Perplexity: 48213832.0000

Sentence: more than a year had been consumed in this undertaking, the only tools for which had been a chisel, a knife, and a wooden lever; faria still continuing to instruct dantès by conversing with him, sometimes in one language, sometimes in another; at others, relating to him the history of nations and great men who from time to time have risen to fame and trodden the path of glory.
Perplexity: 32566096.0000

Sentence: the abbé was a man of the world, and had, moreover, mixed in the first society of the day; he wore an air of melancholy dignity which dantès, thanks to the imitative powers bestowed on him by nature, easily acquired, as well as that outward polish and politeness he had before been wanting in, and which is seldom possessed except by those who have been placed in constant intercourse with persons of high birth and breeding.
Perplexity: 99420160.0000

Sentence: at the end of fifteen months the level was finished, and the excavation completed beneath the gallery, and the two workmen could distinctly hear the measured tread of the sentinel as he paced to and fro over their heads.
Perplexity: 1663204224.0000

Sentence: compelled, as they were, to await a night sufficiently dark to favor their flight, they were obliged to defer their final attempt till that auspicious moment should arrive; their greatest dread now was lest the stone through which the sentry was doomed to fall should give way before its right time, and this they had in some measure provided against by propping it up with a small beam which they had discovered in the walls through which they had worked their way.
Perplexity: 507737440.0000

Sentence: dantès was occupied in arranging this piece of wood when he heard faria, who had remained in edmond’s cell for the purpose of cutting a peg to secure their rope-ladder, call to him in a tone indicative of great suffering.

Sentence: what has happened?” “quick!
Perplexity: 168721808.0000

Sentence: quick!” returned the abbé, “listen to what i have to say.” dantès looked in fear and wonder at the livid countenance of faria, whose eyes, already dull and sunken, were surrounded by purple circles, while his lips were white as those of a corpse, and his very hair seemed to stand on end.
Perplexity: 181522400.0000

Sentence: “tell me, i beseech you, what ails you?” cried dantès, letting his chisel fall to the floor.
Perplexity: 47677120.0000

Sentence: “alas,” faltered out the abbé, “all is over with me.
Perplexity: 201168176.0000

Perplexity: 152392576.0000

Sentence: i had a similar attack the year previous to my imprisonment.
Perplexity: 123373368.0000

Sentence: this malady admits but of one remedy; i will tell you what that is.
Perplexity: 191217856.0000

Sentence: go into my cell as quickly as you can; draw out one of the feet that support the bed; you will find it has been hollowed out for the purpose of containing a small phial you will see there half-filled with a red-looking fluid.
Perplexity: 155737104.0000

Sentence: bring it to me—or rather—no, no!—i may be found here, therefore help me back to my room while i have the strength to drag myself along.
Perplexity: 116048536.0000

Sentence: who knows what may happen, or how long the attack may last?” in spite of the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly frustrated his hopes, dantès did not lose his presence of mind, but descended into the passage, dragging his unfortunate companion with him; then, half-carrying, half-supporting him, he managed to reach the abbé’s chamber, when he immediately laid the sufferer on his bed.
Perplexity: 440385920.0000

Sentence: “thanks,” said the poor abbé, shivering as though his veins were filled with ice.
Perplexity: 116194280.0000

Sentence: “i am about to be seized with a fit of catalepsy; when it comes to its height i shall probably lie still and motionless as though dead, uttering neither sigh nor groan.
Perplexity: 119809304.0000

Sentence: on the other hand, the symptoms may be much more violent, and cause me to fall into fearful convulsions, foam at the mouth, and cry out loudly.
Perplexity: 530671104.0000

Sentence: take care my cries are not heard, for if they are it is more than probable i should be removed to another part of the prison, and we be separated forever.
Perplexity: 152675936.0000

Sentence: when i become quite motionless, cold, and rigid as a corpse, then, and not before,—be careful about this,—force open my teeth with the knife, pour from eight to ten drops of the liquor contained in the phial down my throat, and i may perhaps revive.” “perhaps!” exclaimed dantès in grief-stricken tones.
Perplexity: 895793280.0000

Sentence: “help!
Perplexity: 40941104.0000

Sentence: help!” cried the abbé, “i—i—die—i——” 0229m so sudden and violent was the fit that the unfortunate prisoner was unable to complete the sentence; a violent convulsion shook his whole frame, his eyes started from their sockets, his mouth was drawn on one side, his cheeks became purple, he struggled, foamed, dashed himself about, and uttered the most dreadful cries, which, however, dantès prevented from being heard by covering his head with the blanket.
Perplexity: 2179720192.0000

Sentence: the fit lasted two hours; then, more helpless than an infant, and colder and paler than marble, more crushed and broken than a reed trampled under foot, he fell back, doubled up in one last convulsion, and became as rigid as a corpse.
Perplexity: 91688904.0000

Sentence: edmond waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend, then, taking up the knife, he with difficulty forced open the closely fixed jaws, carefully administered the appointed number of drops, and anxiously awaited the result.
Perplexity: 20316936.0000

Sentence: an hour passed away and the old man gave no sign of returning animation.
Perplexity: 1244288512.0000

Perplexity: 122592016.0000

Sentence: at length a slight color tinged the livid cheeks, consciousness returned to the dull, open eyeballs, a faint sigh issued from the lips, and the sufferer made a feeble effort to move.
Perplexity: 980307456.0000

Sentence: “he is saved!
Perplexity: 36805568.0000

Sentence: he is saved!” cried dantès in a paroxysm of delight.
Perplexity: 331374944.0000

Sentence: the sick man was not yet able to speak, but he pointed with evident anxiety towards the door.
Perplexity: 237650608.0000

Sentence: dantès listened, and plainly distinguished the approaching steps of the jailer.
Perplexity: 49777232.0000

Sentence: it was therefore near seven o’clock; but edmond’s anxiety had put all thoughts of time out of his head.
Perplexity: 314370240.0000

Sentence: the young man sprang to the entrance, darted through it, carefully drawing the stone over the opening, and hurried to his cell.
Perplexity: 33635252.0000

Sentence: he had scarcely done so before the door opened, and the jailer saw the prisoner seated as usual on the side of his bed.
Perplexity: 192272240.0000

Sentence: almost before the key had turned in the lock, and before the departing steps of the jailer had died away in the long corridor he had to traverse, dantès, whose restless anxiety concerning his friend left him no desire to touch the food brought him, hurried back to the abbé’s chamber, and raising the stone by pressing his head against it, was soon beside the sick man’s couch.
Perplexity: 62271940.0000

Sentence: faria had now fully regained his consciousness, but he still lay helpless and exhausted on his miserable bed.
Perplexity: 3143176704.0000

Sentence: “i did not expect to see you again,” said he feebly, to dantès.

Perplexity: 234260448.0000

Sentence: “did you fancy yourself dying?” “no, i had no such idea; but, knowing that all was ready for flight, i thought you might have made your escape.” the deep glow of indignation suffused the cheeks of dantès.
Perplexity: 43230384.0000

Sentence: “without you?
Perplexity: 72787448.0000

Sentence: did you really think me capable of that?” “at least,” said the abbé, “i now see how wrong such an opinion would have been.
Perplexity: 42681040.0000

Sentence: alas, alas!
Perplexity: 399423360.0000

Sentence: i am fearfully exhausted and debilitated by this attack.” “be of good cheer,” replied dantès; “your strength will return.” and as he spoke he seated himself near the bed beside faria, and took his hands.
Perplexity: 57345392.0000

Sentence: the abbé shook his head.
Perplexity: 1299298304.0000

Sentence: “the last attack i had,” said he, “lasted but half an hour, and after it i was hungry, and got up without help; now i can move neither my right arm nor leg, and my head seems uncomfortable, which shows that there has been a suffusion of blood on the brain.
Perplexity: 347491968.0000

Sentence: the third attack will either carry me off, or leave me paralyzed for life.” “no, no,” cried dantès; “you are mistaken—you will not die!
Perplexity: 2626658048.0000

Sentence: and your third attack (if, indeed, you should have another) will find you at liberty.
Perplexity: 389906624.0000

Sentence: we shall save you another time, as we have done this, only with a better chance of success, because we shall be able to command every requisite assistance.” “my good edmond,” answered the abbé, “be not deceived.
Perplexity: 110039280.0000

Sentence: the attack which has just passed away, condemns me forever to the walls of a prison.
Perplexity: 44487708.0000

Sentence: since the first attack i experienced of this malady, i have continually reflected on it.
Perplexity: 484121568.0000

Perplexity: 228473568.0000

Sentence: the physician who prepared for me the remedy i have twice successfully taken, was no other than the celebrated cabanis, and he predicted a similar end for me.” 0233m “the physician may be mistaken!” exclaimed dantès.

Sentence: “then i shall also remain.” then, rising and extending his hand with an air of solemnity over the old man’s head, he slowly added, “by the blood of christ i swear never to leave you while you live.” faria gazed fondly on his noble-minded, single-hearted, high-principled young friend, and read in his countenance ample confirmation of the sincerity of his devotion and the loyalty of his purpose.

Perplexity: 185704816.0000

Sentence: that would bring about a discovery which would inevitably lead to our being separated.
Perplexity: 90124776.0000

Perplexity: 74979744.0000

Sentence: i shall have something of the greatest importance to communicate to you.” dantès took the hand of the abbé in his, and affectionately pressed it.

Sentence: the treasure when dantès returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in captivity, he found faria seated and looking composed.
Perplexity: 4282827776.0000

Sentence: in the ray of light which entered by the narrow window of his cell, he held open in his left hand, of which alone, it will be recollected, he retained the use, a sheet of paper, which, from being constantly rolled into a small compass, had the form of a cylinder, and was not easily kept open.

Sentence: “i have looked at it with all possible attention,” said dantès, “and i only see a half-burnt paper, on which are traces of gothic characters inscribed with a peculiar kind of ink.” “this paper, my friend,” said faria, “i may now avow to you, since i have the proof of your fidelity—this paper is my treasure, of which, from this day forth, one-half belongs to you.” the sweat started forth on dantès’ brow.
Perplexity: 781007424.0000

Sentence: until this day and for how long a time!—he had refrained from talking of the treasure, which had brought upon the abbé the accusation of madness.
Perplexity: 77587272.0000

Sentence: with his instinctive delicacy edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord, and faria had been equally silent.
Perplexity: 98418128.0000

Sentence: “your treasure?” stammered dantès.
Perplexity: 224959296.0000

Perplexity: 2350823424.0000

Perplexity: 218148256.0000

Sentence: “who knows if tomorrow, or the next day after, the third attack may not come on?
Perplexity: 149028592.0000

Perplexity: 349116960.0000

Perplexity: 181563600.0000

Sentence: “yes; a thousand times, yes!” “and who completed it as it now is?” “i did.
Perplexity: 402046560.0000

Sentence: aided by the remaining fragment, i guessed the rest; measuring the length of the lines by those of the paper, and divining the hidden meaning by means of what was in part revealed, as we are guided in a cavern by the small ray of light above us.” “and what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion?” “i resolved to set out, and did set out at that very instant, carrying with me the beginning of my great work, the unity of the italian kingdom; but for some time the imperial police (who at this period, quite contrary to what napoleon desired so soon as he had a son born to him, wished for a partition of provinces) had their eyes on me; and my hasty departure, the cause of which they were unable to guess, having aroused their suspicions, i was arrested at the very moment i was leaving piombino.
Perplexity: 4783483904.0000

Sentence: “now,” continued faria, addressing dantès with an almost paternal expression, “now, my dear fellow, you know as much as i do myself.
Perplexity: 2998244608.0000

Sentence: if we ever escape together, half this treasure is yours; if i die here, and you escape alone, the whole belongs to you.” “but,” inquired dantès hesitating, “has this treasure no more legitimate possessor in the world than ourselves?” “no, no, be easy on that score; the family is extinct.
Perplexity: 680878144.0000

Sentence: the last count of spada, moreover, made me his heir, bequeathing to me this symbolic breviary, he bequeathed to me all it contained; no, no, make your mind satisfied on that point.
Perplexity: 32571688.0000

Sentence: if we lay hands on this fortune, we may enjoy it without remorse.” “and you say this treasure amounts to——” “two millions of roman crowns; nearly thirteen millions of our money.”2 “impossible!” said dantès, staggered at the enormous amount.
Perplexity: 77624432.0000

Sentence: “impossible?
Perplexity: 497917824.0000

Sentence: and why?” asked the old man.
Perplexity: 139248672.0000

Sentence: “the spada family was one of the oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century; and in those times, when other opportunities for investment were wanting, such accumulations of gold and jewels were by no means rare; there are at this day roman families perishing of hunger, though possessed of nearly a million in diamonds and jewels, handed down by entail, and which they cannot touch.” edmond thought he was in a dream—he wavered between incredulity and joy.
Perplexity: 72257248.0000

Sentence: “i have only kept this secret so long from you,” continued faria, “that i might test your character, and then surprise you.

Perplexity: 416238656.0000

Sentence: i have no right to it.
Perplexity: 402814912.0000

Sentence: i am no relation of yours.” “you are my son, dantès,” exclaimed the old man.
Perplexity: 78608080.0000

Sentence: “you are the child of my captivity.
Perplexity: 1357340800.0000

Sentence: my profession condemns me to celibacy.
Perplexity: 92491080.0000

Sentence: god has sent you to me to console, at one and the same time, the man who could not be a father, and the prisoner who could not get free.” and faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to the young man, who threw himself upon his neck and wept.
Perplexity: 30963972.0000

Sentence: the third attack now that this treasure, which had so long been the object of the abbé’s meditations, could insure the future happiness of him whom faria really loved as a son, it had doubled its value in his eyes, and every day he expatiated on the amount, explaining to dantès all the good which, with thirteen or fourteen millions of francs, a man could do in these days to his friends; and then dantès’ countenance became gloomy, for the oath of vengeance he had taken recurred to his memory, and he reflected how much ill, in these times, a man with thirteen or fourteen millions could do to his enemies.
Perplexity: 7754844160.0000

Sentence: the abbé did not know the island of monte cristo; but dantès knew it, and had often passed it, situated twenty-five miles from pianosa, between corsica and the island of elba, and had once touched there.

Sentence: this island was, always had been, and still is, completely deserted.
Perplexity: 402046560.0000

Sentence: dantès drew a plan of the island for faria, and faria gave dantès advice as to the means he should employ to recover the treasure.
Perplexity: 71315376.0000

Sentence: but dantès was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man.
Perplexity: 77988904.0000

Sentence: it was past a question now that faria was not a lunatic, and the way in which he had achieved the discovery, which had given rise to the suspicion of his madness, increased edmond’s admiration of him; but at the same time dantès could not believe that the deposit, supposing it had ever existed, still existed; and though he considered the treasure as by no means chimerical, he yet believed it was no longer there.
Perplexity: 93859304.0000

Sentence: however, as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last chance, and making them understand that they were condemned to perpetual imprisonment, a new misfortune befell them; the gallery on the sea side, which had long been in ruins, was rebuilt.
Perplexity: 213364912.0000

Sentence: they had repaired it completely, and stopped up with vast masses of stone the hole dantès had partly filled in.
Perplexity: 96805296.0000

Sentence: but for this precaution, which, it will be remembered, the abbé had made to edmond, the misfortune would have been still greater, for their attempt to escape would have been detected, and they would undoubtedly have been separated.
Perplexity: 42115696.0000

Sentence: thus a new, a stronger, and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the realization of their hopes.
Perplexity: 65563104.0000

Perplexity: 25366420.0000

Sentence: the treasure will be no more mine than yours, and neither of us will quit this prison.
Perplexity: 28375090.0000

Sentence: but my real treasure is not that, my dear friend, which awaits me beneath the sombre rocks of monte cristo, it is your presence, our living together five or six hours a day, in spite of our jailers; it is the rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain, the languages you have implanted in my memory, and which have taken root there with all their philological ramifications.
Perplexity: 1406273280.0000

Sentence: these different sciences that you have made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of them, and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced them—this is my treasure, my beloved friend, and with this you have made me rich and happy.
Perplexity: 963268288.0000

Sentence: believe me, and take comfort, this is better for me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds, even were they not as problematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the sea, which we take for _terra firma_, and which evaporate and vanish as we draw near to them.
Perplexity: 421500352.0000

Sentence: to have you as long as possible near me, to hear your eloquent speech,—which embellishes my mind, strengthens my soul, and makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible things, if i should ever be free,—so fills my whole existence, that the despair to which i was just on the point of yielding when i knew you, has no longer any hold over me; and this—this is my fortune—not chimerical, but actual.
Perplexity: 37499792.0000

Sentence: i owe you my real good, my present happiness; and all the sovereigns of the earth, even cæsar borgia himself, could not deprive me of this.” thus, if not actually happy, yet the days these two unfortunates passed together went quickly.
Perplexity: 353516672.0000

Sentence: faria, who for so long a time had kept silence as to the treasure, now perpetually talked of it.
Perplexity: 65058724.0000

Sentence: as he had prophesied would be the case, he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left leg, and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself.
Perplexity: 606590144.0000

Sentence: but he was continually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion, and anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy.
Perplexity: 243361056.0000

Sentence: for fear the letter might be some day lost or stolen, he compelled dantès to learn it by heart; and dantès knew it from the first to the last word.
Perplexity: 207529392.0000

Sentence: then he destroyed the second portion, assured that if the first were seized, no one would be able to discover its real meaning.
Perplexity: 99075264.0000

Sentence: whole hours sometimes passed while faria was giving instructions to dantès,—instructions which were to serve him when he was at liberty.
Perplexity: 167610416.0000

Sentence: then, once free, from the day and hour and moment when he was so, he could have but one only thought, which was, to gain monte cristo by some means, and remain there alone under some pretext which would arouse no suspicions; and once there, to endeavor to find the wonderful caverns, and search in the appointed spot,—the appointed spot, be it remembered, being the farthest angle in the second opening.
Perplexity: 493447808.0000

Sentence: in the meanwhile the hours passed, if not rapidly, at least tolerably.
Perplexity: 105364936.0000

Sentence: faria, as we have said, without having recovered the use of his hand and foot, had regained all the clearness of his understanding, and had gradually, besides the moral instructions we have detailed, taught his youthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner, who learns to make something from nothing.
Perplexity: 2056856576.0000

Sentence: they were thus perpetually employed,—faria, that he might not see himself grow old; dantès, for fear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his memory like a distant light wandering in the night.
Perplexity: 135987440.0000

Sentence: so life went on for them as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose activities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of providence.
Perplexity: 71608840.0000

Sentence: but beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young man, and perhaps in that of the old man, many repressed desires, many stifled sighs, which found vent when faria was left alone, and when edmond returned to his cell.

Perplexity: 86621248.0000

Perplexity: 139838208.0000

Sentence: by the light of the wretched and wavering lamp, of which we have spoken, dantès saw the old man, pale, but yet erect, clinging to the bedstead.
Perplexity: 44664980.0000

Perplexity: 1272601088.0000

Sentence: “alas, my dear friend,” said faria in a resigned tone, “you understand, do you not, and i need not attempt to explain to you?” edmond uttered a cry of agony, and, quite out of his senses, rushed towards the door, exclaiming, “help, help!” faria had just sufficient strength to restrain him.
Perplexity: 246402592.0000

Sentence: “silence,” he said, “or you are lost.
Perplexity: 29730602.0000

Sentence: we must now only think of you, my dear friend, and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your flight possible.
Perplexity: 1457823104.0000

Perplexity: 84411400.0000

Sentence: besides, be assured, my dear edmond, the dungeon i am about to leave will not long remain empty; some other unfortunate being will soon take my place, and to him you will appear like an angel of salvation.

Perplexity: 3426213120.0000

Sentence: at length providence has done something for you; he restores to you more than he takes away, and it was time i should die.” edmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim, “oh, my friend, my friend, speak not thus!” and then resuming all his presence of mind, which had for a moment staggered under this blow, and his strength, which had failed at the words of the old man, he said, “oh, i have saved you once, and i will save you a second time!” and raising the foot of the bed, he drew out the phial, still a third filled with the red liquor.
Perplexity: 42647676.0000

Sentence: tell me what i must do this time; are there any fresh instructions?
Perplexity: 12378061.0000

Sentence: speak, my friend; i listen.” “there is not a hope,” replied faria, shaking his head, “but no matter; god wills it that man whom he has created, and in whose heart he has so profoundly rooted the love of life, should do all in his power to preserve that existence, which, however painful it may be, is yet always so dear.” “oh, yes, yes!” exclaimed dantès; “and i tell you that i will save you yet.” “well, then, try.

Perplexity: 133684712.0000

Perplexity: 69707488.0000

Perplexity: 566672704.0000

Sentence: “i am very sorry for what you tell me,” said the governor, replying to the assurance of the doctor, “that the old man is really dead; for he was a quiet, inoffensive prisoner, happy in his folly, and required no watching.” “ah,” added the turnkey, “there was no occasion for watching him; he would have stayed here fifty years, i’ll answer for it, without any attempt to escape.” “still,” said the governor, “i believe it will be requisite, notwithstanding your certainty, and not that i doubt your science, but in discharge of my official duty, that we should be perfectly assured that the prisoner is dead.” there was a moment of complete silence, during which dantès, still listening, knew that the doctor was examining the corpse a second time.

Sentence: he heard hasty steps, the creaking of a door, people going and coming, and some minutes afterwards a turnkey entered, saying: “here is the brazier, lighted.” there was a moment’s silence, and then was heard the crackling of burning flesh, of which the peculiar and nauseous smell penetrated even behind the wall where dantès was listening in horror.

Sentence: one day, too, when my wife was ill, he gave me a prescription which cured her.” “ah, ah!” said the doctor, “i did not know that i had a rival; but i hope, governor, that you will show him all proper respect in consequence.” “yes, yes, make your mind easy, he shall be decently interred in the newest sack we can find.
Perplexity: 32840994.0000

Sentence: will that satisfy you?” “must this last formality take place in your presence, sir?” inquired a turnkey.
Perplexity: 653642368.0000

Sentence: “certainly.
Perplexity: 195363792.0000

Sentence: but make haste—i cannot stay here all day.” other footsteps, going and coming, were now heard, and a moment afterwards the noise of rustling canvas reached dantès’ ears, the bed creaked, and the heavy footfall of a man who lifts a weight sounded on the floor; then the bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon it.
Perplexity: 83020976.0000

Sentence: “this evening,” said the governor.
Perplexity: 2916226304.0000

Perplexity: 66635984.0000

Sentence: if the poor abbé had not been in such a hurry, he might have had his requiem.” “pooh, pooh;” said the doctor, with the impiety usual in persons of his profession; “he is a churchman.
Perplexity: 329675968.0000

Sentence: god will respect his profession, and not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a priest.” a shout of laughter followed this brutal jest.
Perplexity: 348774176.0000

Perplexity: 52573528.0000

Perplexity: 740392704.0000

Sentence: shut the dungeon as if he were alive—that is all.” then the steps retreated, and the voices died away in the distance; the noise of the door, with its creaking hinges and bolts ceased, and a silence more sombre than that of solitude ensued,—the silence of death, which was all-pervasive, and struck its icy chill to the very soul of dantès.
Perplexity: 33043500.0000

Sentence: then he raised the flag-stone cautiously with his head, and looked carefully around the chamber.
Perplexity: 549449728.0000

Perplexity: 279475008.0000

Sentence: the cemetery of the château d’if on the bed, at full length, and faintly illuminated by the pale light that came from the window, lay a sack of canvas, and under its rude folds was stretched a long and stiffened form; it was faria’s last winding-sheet,—a winding-sheet which, as the turnkey said, cost so little.
Perplexity: 62032244.0000

Sentence: everything was in readiness.
Perplexity: 70695104.0000

Sentence: a barrier had been placed between dantès and his old friend.
Perplexity: 76415144.0000

Sentence: no longer could edmond look into those wide-open eyes which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of death; no longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make his existence blessed.
Perplexity: 559120896.0000

Sentence: faria, the beneficent and cheerful companion, with whom he was accustomed to live so intimately, no longer breathed.

Perplexity: 156959760.0000

Sentence: was not faria’s fate the better, after all—to solve the problem of life at its source, even at the risk of horrible suffering?
Perplexity: 95074064.0000

Sentence: the idea of suicide, which his friend had driven away and kept away by his cheerful presence, now hovered like a phantom over the abbé’s dead body.
Perplexity: 377673408.0000

Sentence: “if i could die,” he said, “i should go where he goes, and should assuredly find him again.
Perplexity: 788217664.0000

Sentence: but how to die?
Perplexity: 276829760.0000

Sentence: it is very easy,” he went on with a smile; “i will remain here, rush on the first person that opens the door, strangle him, and then they will guillotine me.” but excessive grief is like a storm at sea, where the frail bark is tossed from the depths to the top of the wave.
Perplexity: 26902222.0000

Sentence: dantès recoiled from the idea of so infamous a death, and passed suddenly from despair to an ardent desire for life and liberty.

Perplexity: 184152848.0000

Sentence: die?
Perplexity: 187252736.0000

Sentence: yes, had i died years ago; but now to die would be, indeed, to give way to the sarcasm of destiny.
Perplexity: 468369216.0000

Sentence: no, i want to live; i shall struggle to the very last; i will yet win back the happiness of which i have been deprived.
Perplexity: 371862784.0000

Sentence: before i die i must not forget that i have my executioners to punish, and perhaps, too, who knows, some friends to reward.
Perplexity: 124888624.0000

Sentence: yet they will forget me here, and i shall die in my dungeon like faria.” as he said this, he became silent and gazed straight before him like one overwhelmed with a strange and amazing thought.
Perplexity: 2782666496.0000

Sentence: suddenly he arose, lifted his hand to his brow as if his brain were giddy, paced twice or thrice round the dungeon, and then paused abruptly by the bed.
Perplexity: 895089664.0000

Sentence: “just god!” he muttered, “whence comes this thought?
Perplexity: 26344424.0000

Sentence: is it from thee?
Perplexity: 17069877248.0000

Sentence: since none but the dead pass freely from this dungeon, let me take the place of the dead!” without giving himself time to reconsider his decision, and, indeed, that he might not allow his thoughts to be distracted from his desperate resolution, he bent over the appalling shroud, opened it with the knife which faria had made, drew the corpse from the sack, and bore it along the tunnel to his own chamber, laid it on his couch, tied around its head the rag he wore at night around his own, covered it with his counterpane, once again kissed the ice-cold brow, and tried vainly to close the resisting eyes, which glared horribly, turned the head towards the wall, so that the jailer might, when he brought the evening meal, believe that he was asleep, as was his frequent custom; entered the tunnel again, drew the bed against the wall, returned to the other cell, took from the hiding-place the needle and thread, flung off his rags, that they might feel only naked flesh beneath the coarse canvas, and getting inside the sack, placed himself in the posture in which the dead body had been laid, and sewed up the mouth of the sack from the inside.
Perplexity: 368315712.0000

Sentence: he would have been discovered by the beating of his heart, if by any mischance the jailers had entered at that moment.
Perplexity: 71718192.0000

Sentence: dantès might have waited until the evening visit was over, but he was afraid that the governor would change his mind, and order the dead body to be removed earlier.
Perplexity: 4783483904.0000

Sentence: in that case his last hope would have been destroyed.
Perplexity: 2998244608.0000

Perplexity: 272531680.0000

Sentence: if while he was being carried out the grave-diggers should discover that they were bearing a live instead of a dead body, dantès did not intend to give them time to recognize him, but with a sudden cut of the knife, he meant to open the sack from top to bottom, and, profiting by their alarm, escape; if they tried to catch him, he would use his knife to better purpose.
Perplexity: 35648696.0000

Sentence: 0263m if they took him to the cemetery and laid him in a grave, he would allow himself to be covered with earth, and then, as it was night, the grave-diggers could scarcely have turned their backs before he would have worked his way through the yielding soil and escaped.
Perplexity: 67638632.0000

Sentence: he hoped that the weight of earth would not be so great that he could not overcome it.
Perplexity: 81829640.0000

Perplexity: 31807458.0000

Sentence: dantès had not eaten since the preceding evening, but he had not thought of hunger, nor did he think of it now.
Perplexity: 104434122752.0000

Sentence: his situation was too precarious to allow him even time to reflect on any thought but one.
Perplexity: 159922464.0000

Sentence: the first risk that dantès ran was, that the jailer, when he brought him his supper at seven o’clock, might perceive the change that had been made; fortunately, twenty times at least, from misanthropy or fatigue, dantès had received his jailer in bed, and then the man placed his bread and soup on the table, and went away without saying a word.
Perplexity: 69926280.0000

Sentence: this time the jailer might not be as silent as usual, but speak to dantès, and seeing that he received no reply, go to the bed, and thus discover all.

Perplexity: 217251792.0000

Perplexity: 73287280.0000

Sentence: the footsteps—they were double—paused at the door—and dantès guessed that the two grave-diggers had come to seek him—this idea was soon converted into certainty, when he heard the noise they made in putting down the hand-bier.
Perplexity: 167162480.0000

Sentence: the door opened, and a dim light reached dantès’ eyes through the coarse sack that covered him; he saw two shadows approach his bed, a third remaining at the door with a torch in its hand.

Sentence: “have you tied the knot?” inquired the first speaker.
Perplexity: 338189280.0000

Sentence: “what would be the use of carrying so much more weight?” was the reply, “i can do that when we get there.” “yes, you’re right,” replied the companion.
Perplexity: 1234233344.0000

Sentence: “what’s the knot for?” thought dantès.
Perplexity: 589651136.0000

Sentence: they deposited the supposed corpse on the bier.
Perplexity: 101105296.0000

Sentence: “what can he be looking for?” thought edmond.
Perplexity: 486559872.0000

Sentence: “the spade, perhaps.” an exclamation of satisfaction indicated that the grave-digger had found the object of his search.
Perplexity: 161494016.0000

Sentence: “here it is at last,” he said, “not without some trouble, though.” “yes,” was the answer, “but it has lost nothing by waiting.” as he said this, the man came towards edmond, who heard a heavy metallic substance laid down beside him, and at the same moment a cord was fastened round his feet with sudden and painful violence.
Perplexity: 38360972.0000

Sentence: “well, have you tied the knot?” inquired the grave-digger, who was looking on.

Sentence: dantès did not comprehend the jest, but his hair stood erect on his head.
Perplexity: 376389760.0000

Sentence: “well, here we are at last,” said one of them.
Perplexity: 498333056.0000

Sentence: “a little farther—a little farther,” said the other.
Perplexity: 48892820.0000

Sentence: “you know very well that the last was stopped on his way, dashed on the rocks, and the governor told us next day that we were careless fellows.” they ascended five or six more steps, and then dantès felt that they took him, one by the head and the other by the heels, and swung him to and fro.
Perplexity: 29460044.0000

Sentence: “one!” said the grave-diggers, “two!
Perplexity: 66161316.0000

Perplexity: 131491936.0000

Perplexity: 114468576.0000

Sentence: behind him, blacker than the sea, blacker than the sky, rose phantom-like the vast stone structure, whose projecting crags seemed like arms extended to seize their prey, and on the highest rock was a torch lighting two figures.

Perplexity: 139364512.0000

Sentence: dantès, though almost sure as to what course the vessel would take, had yet watched it anxiously until it tacked and stood towards him.

Perplexity: 120005528.0000

Sentence: he rose again to the surface, struggled with the last desperate effort of a drowning man, uttered a third cry, and felt himself sinking, as if the fatal cannon shot were again tied to his feet.

Sentence: they were rapidly leaving the château d’if behind.
Perplexity: 296097344.0000

Sentence: dantès was so exhausted that the exclamation of joy he uttered was mistaken for a sigh.
Perplexity: 1213169280.0000

Sentence: as we have said, he was lying on the deck.
Perplexity: 541359680.0000

Sentence: a sailor was rubbing his limbs with a woollen cloth; another, whom he recognized as the one who had cried out “courage!” held a gourd full of rum to his mouth; while the third, an old sailor, at once the pilot and captain, looked on with that egotistical pity men feel for a misfortune that they have escaped yesterday, and which may overtake them tomorrow.
Perplexity: 1578590464.0000

Sentence: a few drops of the rum restored suspended animation, while the friction of his limbs restored their elasticity.

Perplexity: 608561344.0000

Perplexity: 129863872.0000

Sentence: i saw your vessel, and fearful of being left to perish on the desolate island, i swam off on a piece of wreckage to try and intercept your course.
Perplexity: 108500976.0000

Sentence: you have saved my life, and i thank you,” continued dantès.
Perplexity: 39033204.0000

Sentence: “i was lost when one of your sailors caught hold of my hair.” “it was i,” said a sailor of a frank and manly appearance; “and it was time, for you were sinking.” “yes,” returned dantès, holding out his hand, “i thank you again.” “i almost hesitated, though,” replied the sailor; “you looked more like a brigand than an honest man, with your beard six inches, and your hair a foot long.” dantès recollected that his hair and beard had not been cut all the time he was at the château d’if.
Perplexity: 2867374848.0000

Sentence: “yes,” said he, “i made a vow, to our lady of the grotto not to cut my hair or beard for ten years if i were saved in a moment of danger; but today the vow expires.” “now what are we to do with you?” said the captain.
Perplexity: 273258816.0000

Perplexity: 298239872.0000

Sentence: “but in his present condition he will promise anything, and take his chance of keeping it afterwards.” “i will do more than i promise,” said dantès.
Perplexity: 196657360.0000

Sentence: “we shall see,” returned the other, smiling.
Perplexity: 166655680.0000

Sentence: “where are you going?” asked dantès.
Perplexity: 38998304.0000

Sentence: “to leghorn.” “then why, instead of tacking so frequently, do you not sail nearer the wind?” “because we should run straight on to the island of rion.” “you shall pass it by twenty fathoms.” “take the helm, and let us see what you know.” the young man took the helm, felt to see if the vessel answered the rudder promptly and seeing that, without being a first-rate sailor, she yet was tolerably obedient.
Perplexity: 54329372.0000

Sentence: “to the sheets,” said he.
Perplexity: 763560320.0000

Perplexity: 47760672.0000

Sentence: “bravo!” said the captain.
Perplexity: 329184608.0000

Perplexity: 40331056.0000

Sentence: “you see,” said dantès, quitting the helm, “i shall be of some use to you, at least during the voyage.
Perplexity: 57038320.0000

Sentence: if you do not want me at leghorn, you can leave me there, and i will pay you out of the first wages i get, for my food and the clothes you lend me.” “ah,” said the captain, “we can agree very well, if you are reasonable.” “give me what you give the others, and it will be all right,” returned dantès.
Perplexity: 319191776.0000

Sentence: “that’s not fair,” said the seaman who had saved dantès; “for you know more than we do.” “what is that to you, jacopo?” returned the captain.
Perplexity: 249495024.0000

Sentence: “everyone is free to ask what he pleases.” “that’s true,” replied jacopo; “i only make a remark.” “well, you would do much better to find him a jacket and a pair of trousers, if you have them.” “no,” said jacopo; “but i have a shirt and a pair of trousers.” “that is all i want,” interrupted dantès.
Perplexity: 125632608.0000

Sentence: jacopo dived into the hold and soon returned with what edmond wanted.
Perplexity: 963485056.0000

Perplexity: 89526328.0000

Sentence: a piece of bread was brought, and jacopo offered him the gourd.
Perplexity: 552697536.0000

Sentence: “larboard your helm,” cried the captain to the steersman.
Perplexity: 306757696.0000

Perplexity: 94044240.0000

Sentence: “hollo!
Perplexity: 342046560.0000

Sentence: what’s the matter at the château d’if?” said the captain.
Perplexity: 41164184.0000

Sentence: a small white cloud, which had attracted dantès’ attention, crowned the summit of the bastion of the château d’if.

Perplexity: 577589312.0000

Sentence: the sailors looked at one another.
Perplexity: 98944768.0000

Sentence: “what is this?” asked the captain.
Perplexity: 76346816.0000

Sentence: “a prisoner has escaped from the château d’if, and they are firing the alarm gun,” replied dantès.
Perplexity: 176325888.0000

Perplexity: 105935616.0000

Sentence: 0277m “pretty strong rum!” said dantès, wiping his brow with his sleeve.
Perplexity: 149433344.0000

Sentence: “at any rate,” murmured he, “if it be, so much the better, for i have made a rare acquisition.” 0279m under pretence of being fatigued, dantès asked to take the helm; the steersman, glad to be relieved, looked at the captain, and the latter by a sign indicated that he might abandon it to his new comrade.
Perplexity: 35915616.0000

Sentence: dantès could thus keep his eyes on marseilles.
Perplexity: 1778116608.0000

Perplexity: 182138320.0000

Sentence: “the 28th of february.” “in what year?” “in what year—you ask me in what year?” “yes,” replied the young man, “i ask you in what year!” “you have forgotten then?” “i got such a fright last night,” replied dantès, smiling, “that i have almost lost my memory.
Perplexity: 146888368.0000

Sentence: i ask you what year is it?” “the year 1829,” returned jacopo.
Perplexity: 64700228.0000

Perplexity: 567898624.0000

Sentence: he was nineteen when he entered the château d’if; he was thirty-three when he escaped.
Perplexity: 135492944.0000

Sentence: a sorrowful smile passed over his face; he asked himself what had become of mercédès, who must believe him dead.
Perplexity: 1218430976.0000

Sentence: then his eyes lighted up with hatred as he thought of the three men who had caused him so long and wretched a captivity.
Perplexity: 342429728.0000

Sentence: he renewed against danglars, fernand, and villefort the oath of implacable vengeance he had made in his dungeon.
Perplexity: 336201952.0000

Sentence: this oath was no longer a vain menace; for the fastest sailor in the mediterranean would have been unable to overtake the little tartan, that with every stitch of canvas set was flying before the wind to leghorn.
Perplexity: 163978048.0000

Sentence: the smugglers dantès had not been a day on board before he had a very clear idea of the men with whom his lot had been cast.
Perplexity: 843753920.0000

Sentence: without having been in the school of the abbé faria, the worthy master of _la jeune amélie_ (the name of the genoese tartan) knew a smattering of all the tongues spoken on the shores of that large lake called the mediterranean, from the arabic to the provençal, and this, while it spared him interpreters, persons always troublesome and frequently indiscreet, gave him great facilities of communication, either with the vessels he met at sea, with the small boats sailing along the coast, or with the people without name, country, or occupation, who are always seen on the quays of seaports, and who live by hidden and mysterious means which we must suppose to be a direct gift of providence, as they have no visible means of support.
Perplexity: 135082912.0000

Sentence: it is fair to assume that dantès was on board a smuggler.
Perplexity: 661330880.0000

Sentence: at first the captain had received dantès on board with a certain degree of distrust.
Perplexity: 60086568.0000

Sentence: he was very well known to the customs officers of the coast; and as there was between these worthies and himself a perpetual battle of wits, he had at first thought that dantès might be an emissary of these industrious guardians of rights and duties, who perhaps employed this ingenious means of learning some of the secrets of his trade.
Perplexity: 407518816.0000

Sentence: but the skilful manner in which dantès had handled the lugger had entirely reassured him; and then, when he saw the light plume of smoke floating above the bastion of the château d’if, and heard the distant report, he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his vessel one whose coming and going, like that of kings, was accompanied with salutes of artillery.
Perplexity: 25835714.0000

Sentence: this made him less uneasy, it must be owned, than if the new-comer had proved to be a customs officer; but this supposition also disappeared like the first, when he beheld the perfect tranquillity of his recruit.
Perplexity: 1437841152.0000

Sentence: edmond thus had the advantage of knowing what the owner was, without the owner knowing who he was; and however the old sailor and his crew tried to “pump” him, they extracted nothing more from him; he gave accurate descriptions of naples and malta, which he knew as well as marseilles, and held stoutly to his first story.
Perplexity: 28982128.0000

Sentence: thus the genoese, subtle as he was, was duped by edmond, in whose favor his mild demeanor, his nautical skill, and his admirable dissimulation, pleaded.
Perplexity: 51851536.0000

Sentence: moreover, it is possible that the genoese was one of those shrewd persons who know nothing but what they should know, and believe nothing but what they should believe.
Perplexity: 1939674496.0000

Sentence: in this state of mutual understanding, they reached leghorn.
Perplexity: 60448664.0000

Sentence: here edmond was to undergo another trial; he was to find out whether he could recognize himself, as he had not seen his own face for fourteen years.
Perplexity: 967431424.0000

Sentence: he had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been, and was now to find out what the man had become.
Perplexity: 168638160.0000

Sentence: his comrades believed that his vow was fulfilled.
Perplexity: 789945472.0000

Sentence: as he had twenty times touched at leghorn, he remembered a barber in st. ferdinand street; he went there to have his beard and hair cut.
Perplexity: 825956800.0000

Sentence: the barber gazed in amazement at this man with the long, thick and black hair and beard, which gave his head the appearance of one of titian’s portraits.
Perplexity: 103174568.0000

Sentence: at this period it was not the fashion to wear so large a beard and hair so long; now a barber would only be surprised if a man gifted with such advantages should consent voluntarily to deprive himself of them.
Perplexity: 30246404.0000

Sentence: the leghorn barber said nothing and went to work.
Perplexity: 354980192.0000

Sentence: when the operation was concluded, and edmond felt that his chin was completely smooth, and his hair reduced to its usual length, he asked for a looking-glass.
Perplexity: 61159228.0000

Sentence: he was now, as we have said, three-and-thirty years of age, and his fourteen years’ imprisonment had produced a great transformation in his appearance.
Perplexity: 37522832.0000

Sentence: dantès had entered the château d’if with the round, open, smiling face of a young and happy man, with whom the early paths of life have been smooth, and who anticipates a future corresponding with his past.
Perplexity: 1064550080.0000

Sentence: this was now all changed.
Perplexity: 370000672.0000

Sentence: the oval face was lengthened, his smiling mouth had assumed the firm and marked lines which betoken resolution; his eyebrows were arched beneath a brow furrowed with thought; his eyes were full of melancholy, and from their depths occasionally sparkled gloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred; his complexion, so long kept from the sun, had now that pale color which produces, when the features are encircled with black hair, the aristocratic beauty of the man of the north; the profound learning he had acquired had besides diffused over his features a refined intellectual expression; and he had also acquired, being naturally of a goodly stature, that vigor which a frame possesses which has so long concentrated all its force within itself.
Perplexity: 62359064.0000

Sentence: 0283m to the elegance of a nervous and slight form had succeeded the solidity of a rounded and muscular figure.
Perplexity: 509749920.0000

Sentence: as to his voice, prayers, sobs, and imprecations had changed it so that at times it was of a singularly penetrating sweetness, and at others rough and almost hoarse.
Perplexity: 19991652.0000

Sentence: moreover, from being so long in twilight or darkness, his eyes had acquired the faculty of distinguishing objects in the night, common to the hyena and the wolf.
Perplexity: 103326600.0000

Sentence: edmond smiled when he beheld himself; it was impossible that his best friend—if, indeed, he had any friend left—could recognize him; he could not recognize himself.

Perplexity: 45358488.0000

Sentence: “i would rather do so,” was edmond’s reply, “than suffer the inexpressible agonies which the slightest movement causes me.” the patron turned towards his vessel, which was rolling on the swell in the little harbor, and, with sails partly set, would be ready for sea when her toilet should be completed.

Perplexity: 860283904.0000

Sentence: a day or two of rest will set me up, and i hope i shall find among the rocks certain herbs most excellent for bruises.” a peculiar smile passed over dantès’ lips; he squeezed jacopo’s hand warmly, but nothing could shake his determination to remain—and remain alone.
Perplexity: 628118720.0000

Sentence: the smugglers left with edmond what he had requested and set sail, but not without turning about several times, and each time making signs of a cordial farewell, to which edmond replied with his hand only, as if he could not move the rest of his body.
Perplexity: 34151900.0000

Sentence: then, when they had disappeared, he said with a smile,—“’tis strange that it should be among such men that we find proofs of friendship and devotion.” then he dragged himself cautiously to the top of a rock, from which he had a full view of the sea, and thence he saw the tartan complete her preparations for sailing, weigh anchor, and, balancing herself as gracefully as a water-fowl ere it takes to the wing, set sail.

Perplexity: 372878400.0000

Perplexity: 3062001920.0000

Sentence: but it was not upon corsica, the very houses of which he could distinguish; or on sardinia; or on the island of elba, with its historical associations; or upon the almost imperceptible line that to the experienced eye of a sailor alone revealed the coast of genoa the proud, and leghorn the commercial, that he gazed.

Perplexity: 36178116.0000

Sentence: then he descended with cautious and slow step, for he dreaded lest an accident similar to that he had so adroitly feigned should happen in reality.
Perplexity: 3203367168.0000

Perplexity: 135426800.0000

Perplexity: 164330608.0000

Sentence: and he sprang from the rock in order to inspect the base on which it had formerly stood.
Perplexity: 33176244.0000

Sentence: he soon perceived that a slope had been formed, and the rock had slid along this until it stopped at the spot it now occupied.
Perplexity: 362123808.0000

Sentence: a large stone had served as a wedge; flints and pebbles had been inserted around it, so as to conceal the orifice; this species of masonry had been covered with earth, and grass and weeds had grown there, moss had clung to the stones, myrtle-bushes had taken root, and the old rock seemed fixed to the earth.
Perplexity: 268600896.0000

Perplexity: 405804672.0000

Sentence: dantès saw that he must attack the wedge.
Perplexity: 556879488.0000

Sentence: but how?
Perplexity: 592689984.0000

Sentence: he cast his eyes around, and saw the horn full of powder which his friend jacopo had left him.
Perplexity: 30874450.0000

Sentence: he smiled; the infernal invention would serve him for this purpose.
Perplexity: 39915736.0000

Sentence: with the aid of his pickaxe, dantès, after the manner of a labor-saving pioneer, dug a mine between the upper rock and the one that supported it, filled it with powder, then made a match by rolling his handkerchief in saltpetre.
Perplexity: 1149287168.0000

Sentence: he lighted it and retired.
Perplexity: 98364832.0000

Sentence: the explosion soon followed; the upper rock was lifted from its base by the terrific force of the powder; the lower one flew into pieces; thousands of insects escaped from the aperture dantès had previously formed, and a huge snake, like the guardian demon of the treasure, rolled himself along in darkening coils, and disappeared.
Perplexity: 123765320.0000

Sentence: dantès approached the upper rock, which now, without any support, leaned towards the sea.
Perplexity: 370414432.0000

Sentence: the rock, already shaken by the explosion, tottered on its base.
Perplexity: 22145716.0000

Sentence: dantès redoubled his efforts; he seemed like one of the ancient titans, who uprooted the mountains to hurl against the father of the gods.
Perplexity: 773721536.0000

Sentence: the rock yielded, rolled over, bounded from point to point, and finally disappeared in the ocean.
Perplexity: 319548736.0000

Sentence: on the spot it had occupied was a circular space, exposing an iron ring let into a square flag-stone.
Perplexity: 170343120.0000

Sentence: dantès uttered a cry of joy and surprise; never had a first attempt been crowned with more perfect success.
Perplexity: 213857104.0000

Sentence: he would fain have continued, but his knees trembled, and his heart beat so violently, and his sight became so dim, that he was forced to pause.
Perplexity: 587806208.0000

Sentence: this feeling lasted but for a moment.
Perplexity: 65663476.0000

Sentence: edmond inserted his lever in the ring and exerted all his strength; the flag-stone yielded, and disclosed steps that descended until they were lost in the obscurity of a subterraneous grotto.
Perplexity: 545328768.0000

Sentence: anyone else would have rushed on with a cry of joy.
Perplexity: 34445696.0000

Sentence: dantès turned pale, hesitated, and reflected.
Perplexity: 22478590.0000

Perplexity: 2507632128.0000

Perplexity: 153737568.0000

Sentence: i must not be cast down by the discovery that i have been deceived.
Perplexity: 81298824.0000

Sentence: what, then, would be the use of all i have suffered?
Perplexity: 624283584.0000

Sentence: the heart breaks when, after having been elated by flattering hopes, it sees all its illusions destroyed.
Perplexity: 27137846.0000

Sentence: faria has dreamed this; the cardinal spada buried no treasure here; perhaps he never came here, or if he did, cæsar borgia, the intrepid adventurer, the stealthy and indefatigable plunderer, has followed him, discovered his traces, pursued them as i have done, raised the stone, and descending before me, has left me nothing.” he remained motionless and pensive, his eyes fixed on the gloomy aperture that was open at his feet.
Perplexity: 159244608.0000

Sentence: “now that i expect nothing, now that i no longer entertain the slightest hopes, the end of this adventure becomes simply a matter of curiosity.” and he remained again motionless and thoughtful.
Perplexity: 390813472.0000

Sentence: “yes, yes; this is an adventure worthy a place in the varied career of that royal bandit.
Perplexity: 448304096.0000

Sentence: this fabulous event formed but a link in a long chain of marvels.
Perplexity: 174130416.0000

Sentence: yes, borgia has been here, a torch in one hand, a sword in the other, and within twenty paces, at the foot of this rock, perhaps two guards kept watch on land and sea, while their master descended, as i am about to descend, dispelling the darkness before his awe-inspiring progress.” 0303m “but what was the fate of the guards who thus possessed his secret?” asked dantès of himself.
Perplexity: 787870464.0000

Sentence: “the fate,” replied he, smiling, “of those who buried alaric, and were interred with the corpse.” “yet, had he come,” thought dantès, “he would have found the treasure, and borgia, he who compared italy to an artichoke, which he could devour leaf by leaf, knew too well the value of time to waste it in replacing this rock.
Perplexity: 50108828.0000

Sentence: i will go down.” then he descended, a smile on his lips, and murmuring that last word of human philosophy, “perhaps!” but instead of the darkness, and the thick and mephitic atmosphere he had expected to find, dantès saw a dim and bluish light, which, as well as the air, entered, not merely by the aperture he had just formed, but by the interstices and crevices of the rock which were visible from without, and through which he could distinguish the blue sky and the waving branches of the evergreen oaks, and the tendrils of the creepers that grew from the rocks.
Perplexity: 2081641984.0000

Sentence: after having stood a few minutes in the cavern, the atmosphere of which was rather warm than damp, dantès’ eye, habituated as it was to darkness, could pierce even to the remotest angles of the cavern, which was of granite that sparkled like diamonds.
Perplexity: 35755880.0000

Sentence: “alas,” said edmond, smiling, “these are the treasures the cardinal has left; and the good abbé, seeing in a dream these glittering walls, has indulged in fallacious hopes.” but he called to mind the words of the will, which he knew by heart.
Perplexity: 2653679616.0000

Sentence: “in the farthest angle of the second opening,” said the cardinal’s will.
Perplexity: 237305456.0000

Sentence: he had only found the first grotto; he had now to seek the second.
Perplexity: 31926710.0000

Sentence: dantès continued his search.
Perplexity: 73211696.0000

Sentence: he reflected that this second grotto must penetrate deeper into the island; he examined the stones, and sounded one part of the wall where he fancied the opening existed, masked for precaution’s sake.
Perplexity: 577589312.0000

Sentence: the pickaxe struck for a moment with a dull sound that drew out of dantès’ forehead large drops of perspiration.
Perplexity: 98944768.0000

Sentence: at last it seemed to him that one part of the wall gave forth a more hollow and deeper echo; he eagerly advanced, and with the quickness of perception that no one but a prisoner possesses, saw that there, in all probability, the opening must be.
Perplexity: 168639120.0000

Sentence: however, he, like cæsar borgia, knew the value of time; and, in order to avoid fruitless toil, he sounded all the other walls with his pickaxe, struck the earth with the butt of his gun, and finding nothing that appeared suspicious, returned to that part of the wall whence issued the consoling sound he had before heard.
Perplexity: 172654432.0000

Sentence: he again struck it, and with greater force.
Perplexity: 54003928.0000

Sentence: then a singular thing occurred.
Perplexity: 437466656.0000

Sentence: as he struck the wall, pieces of stucco similar to that used in the ground work of arabesques broke off, and fell to the ground in flakes, exposing a large white stone.
Perplexity: 121499112.0000

Sentence: the aperture of the rock had been closed with stones, then this stucco had been applied, and painted to imitate granite.
Perplexity: 27251806.0000

Sentence: dantès struck with the sharp end of his pickaxe, which entered someway between the interstices.
Perplexity: 464907840.0000

Sentence: it was there he must dig.
Perplexity: 212727360.0000

Sentence: but by some strange play of emotion, in proportion as the proofs that faria, had not been deceived became stronger, so did his heart give way, and a feeling of discouragement stole over him.
Perplexity: 56670708.0000

Sentence: this last proof, instead of giving him fresh strength, deprived him of it; the pickaxe descended, or rather fell; he placed it on the ground, passed his hand over his brow, and remounted the stairs, alleging to himself, as an excuse, a desire to be assured that no one was watching him, but in reality because he felt that he was about to faint.
Perplexity: 343150240.0000

Sentence: the island was deserted, and the sun seemed to cover it with its fiery glance; afar off, a few small fishing boats studded the bosom of the blue ocean.
Perplexity: 51982940.0000

Sentence: dantès had tasted nothing, but he thought not of hunger at such a moment; he hastily swallowed a few drops of rum, and again entered the cavern.
Perplexity: 76753152.0000

Sentence: the pickaxe that had seemed so heavy, was now like a feather in his grasp; he seized it, and attacked the wall.
Perplexity: 5725495808.0000

Sentence: after several blows he perceived that the stones were not cemented, but had been merely placed one upon the other, and covered with stucco; he inserted the point of his pickaxe, and using the handle as a lever, with joy soon saw the stone turn as if on hinges, and fall at his feet.
Perplexity: 47310604.0000

Sentence: he had nothing more to do now, but with the iron tooth of the pickaxe to draw the stones towards him one by one.
Perplexity: 62671348.0000

Sentence: the aperture was already sufficiently large for him to enter, but by waiting, he could still cling to hope, and retard the certainty of deception.
Perplexity: 52055068.0000

Sentence: at last, after renewed hesitation, dantès entered the second grotto.
Perplexity: 91342416.0000

Sentence: the second grotto was lower and more gloomy than the first; the air that could only enter by the newly formed opening had the mephitic smell dantès was surprised not to find in the outer cavern.
Perplexity: 301248800.0000

Sentence: he waited in order to allow pure air to displace the foul atmosphere, and then went on.
Perplexity: 209142304.0000

Sentence: at the left of the opening was a dark and deep angle.
Perplexity: 39962052.0000

Sentence: but to dantès’ eye there was no darkness.

Sentence: he glanced around this second grotto; it was, like the first, empty.
Perplexity: 393705184.0000

Sentence: the treasure, if it existed, was buried in this corner.
Perplexity: 164189616.0000

Sentence: the time had at length arrived; two feet of earth removed, and dantès’ fate would be decided.
Perplexity: 254827200.0000

Sentence: he advanced towards the angle, and summoning all his resolution, attacked the ground with the pickaxe.
Perplexity: 138877072.0000

Sentence: at the fifth or sixth blow the pickaxe struck against an iron substance.
Perplexity: 203474272.0000

Sentence: never did funeral knell, never did alarm-bell, produce a greater effect on the hearer.
Perplexity: 260441712.0000

Sentence: had dantès found nothing he could not have become more ghastly pale.
Perplexity: 30699578.0000

Sentence: he again struck his pickaxe into the earth, and encountered the same resistance, but not the same sound.
Perplexity: 254860752.0000

Sentence: “it is a casket of wood bound with iron,” thought he.
Perplexity: 106543120.0000

Sentence: at this moment a shadow passed rapidly before the opening; dantès seized his gun, sprang through the opening, and mounted the stair.
Perplexity: 186256784.0000

Sentence: a wild goat had passed before the mouth of the cave, and was feeding at a little distance.
Perplexity: 42409436.0000

Sentence: this would have been a favorable occasion to secure his dinner; but dantès feared lest the report of his gun should attract attention.
Perplexity: 861793216.0000

Perplexity: 63913280.0000

Sentence: descending into the grotto, he lifted the stone, filled his pockets with gems, put the box together as well and securely as he could, sprinkled fresh sand over the spot from which it had been taken, and then carefully trod down the earth to give it everywhere a uniform appearance; then, quitting the grotto, he replaced the stone, heaping on it broken masses of rocks and rough fragments of crumbling granite, filling the interstices with earth, into which he deftly inserted rapidly growing plants, such as the wild myrtle and flowering thorn, then carefully watering these new plantations, he scrupulously effaced every trace of footsteps, leaving the approach to the cavern as savage-looking and untrodden as he had found it.

Perplexity: 165869216.0000

Perplexity: 1491233536.0000

Perplexity: 25858836.0000

Sentence: 0311m edmond preserved the most admirable self-command, not suffering the faintest indication of a smile to escape him at the enumeration of all the benefits he would have reaped had he been able to quit the island; but as _la jeune amélie_ had merely come to monte cristo to fetch him away, he embarked that same evening, and proceeded with the captain to leghorn.

Sentence: the following day dantès presented jacopo with an entirely new vessel, accompanying the gift by a donation of one hundred piastres, that he might provide himself with a suitable crew and other requisites for his outfit, upon condition that he would go at once to marseilles for the purpose of inquiring after an old man named louis dantès, residing in the allées de meilhan, and also a young woman called mercédès, an inhabitant of the catalan village.
Perplexity: 302280800.0000

Sentence: jacopo could scarcely believe his senses at receiving this magnificent present, which dantès hastened to account for by saying that he had merely been a sailor from whim and a desire to spite his family, who did not allow him as much money as he liked to spend; but that on his arrival at leghorn he had come into possession of a large fortune, left him by an uncle, whose sole heir he was.
Perplexity: 34654532.0000

Perplexity: 117140224.0000

Sentence: the proposal was too advantageous to be refused, the more so as the person for whom the yacht was intended had gone upon a tour through switzerland, and was not expected back in less than three weeks or a month, by which time the builder reckoned upon being able to complete another.

Sentence: the delighted builder then offered his services in providing a suitable crew for the little vessel, but this dantès declined with many thanks, saying he was accustomed to cruise about quite alone, and his principal pleasure consisted in managing his yacht himself; the only thing the builder could oblige him in would be to contrive a sort of secret closet in the cabin at his bed’s head, the closet to contain three divisions, so constructed as to be concealed from all but himself.
Perplexity: 735793472.0000

Perplexity: 26237251584.0000

Perplexity: 143546736.0000

Sentence: the spectators followed the little vessel with their eyes as long as it remained visible; they then turned their conjectures upon her probable destination.
Perplexity: 48076452.0000

Perplexity: 94807328.0000

Sentence: 0315m still dantès could not view without a shudder the approach of a gendarme who accompanied the officers deputed to demand his bill of health ere the yacht was permitted to hold communication with the shore; but with that perfect self-possession he had acquired during his acquaintance with faria, dantès coolly presented an english passport he had obtained from leghorn, and as this gave him a standing which a french passport would not have afforded, he was informed that there existed no obstacle to his immediate debarkation.
Perplexity: 1671581056.0000

Perplexity: 327295136.0000

Sentence: “i beg your pardon, sir,” said the honest fellow, in almost breathless haste, “but i believe you made a mistake; you intended to give me a two-franc piece, and see, you gave me a double napoleon.” “thank you, my good friend.
Perplexity: 24456704.0000

Sentence: i see that i have made a trifling mistake, as you say; but by way of rewarding your honesty i give you another double napoleon, that you may drink to my health, and be able to ask your messmates to join you.” so extreme was the surprise of the sailor, that he was unable even to thank edmond, whose receding figure he continued to gaze after in speechless astonishment.

Perplexity: 180898544.0000

Sentence: the bed belonging to the present occupants was placed as the former owner of the chamber had been accustomed to have his; and, in spite of his efforts to prevent it, the eyes of edmond were suffused in tears as he reflected that on that spot the old man had breathed his last, vainly calling for his son.
Perplexity: 683071232.0000

Perplexity: 731868800.0000

Sentence: this small staff was quite equal to all the requirements, for a canal between beaucaire and aiguemortes had revolutionized transportation by substituting boats for the cart and the stagecoach.
Perplexity: 694831872.0000

Sentence: and, as though to add to the daily misery which this prosperous canal inflicted on the unfortunate innkeeper, whose utter ruin it was fast accomplishing, it was situated between the rhône from which it had its source and the post-road it had depleted, not a hundred steps from the inn, of which we have given a brief but faithful description.
Perplexity: 222651216.0000

Sentence: the innkeeper himself was a man of from forty to fifty-five years of age, tall, strong, and bony, a perfect specimen of the natives of those southern latitudes; he had dark, sparkling, and deep-set eyes, hooked nose, and teeth white as those of a carnivorous animal; his hair, like his beard, which he wore under his chin, was thick and curly, and in spite of his age but slightly interspersed with a few silvery threads.
Perplexity: 32118558.0000

Sentence: his naturally dark complexion had assumed a still further shade of brown from the habit the unfortunate man had acquired of stationing himself from morning till eve at the threshold of his door, on the lookout for guests who seldom came, yet there he stood, day after day, exposed to the meridional rays of a burning sun, with no other protection for his head than a red handkerchief twisted around it, after the manner of the spanish muleteers.
Perplexity: 363442624.0000

Sentence: this man was our old acquaintance, gaspard caderousse.
Perplexity: 157643520.0000

Sentence: his wife, on the contrary, whose maiden name had been madeleine radelle, was pale, meagre, and sickly-looking.
Perplexity: 157675696.0000

Sentence: born in the neighborhood of arles, she had shared in the beauty for which its women are proverbial; but that beauty had gradually withered beneath the devastating influence of the slow fever so prevalent among dwellers by the ponds of aiguemortes and the marshes of camargue.
Perplexity: 58116612.0000

Sentence: she remained nearly always in her second-floor chamber, shivering in her chair, or stretched languid and feeble on her bed, while her husband kept his daily watch at the door—a duty he performed with so much the greater willingness, as it saved him the necessity of listening to the endless plaints and murmurs of his helpmate, who never saw him without breaking out into bitter invectives against fate; to all of which her husband would calmly return an unvarying reply, in these philosophic words: “hush, la carconte.
Perplexity: 408603040.0000

Sentence: it is god’s pleasure that things should be so.” the sobriquet of la carconte had been bestowed on madeleine radelle from the fact that she had been born in a village, so called, situated between salon and lambesc; and as a custom existed among the inhabitants of that part of france where caderousse lived of styling every person by some particular and distinctive appellation, her husband had bestowed on her the name of la carconte in place of her sweet and euphonious name of madeleine, which, in all probability, his rude gutteral language would not have enabled him to pronounce.
Perplexity: 381014688.0000

Sentence: still, let it not be supposed that amid this affected resignation to the will of providence, the unfortunate innkeeper did not writhe under the double misery of seeing the hateful canal carry off his customers and his profits, and the daily infliction of his peevish partner’s murmurs and lamentations.
Perplexity: 405212992.0000

Sentence: 0323m like other dwellers in the south, he was a man of sober habits and moderate desires, but fond of external show, vain, and addicted to display.
Perplexity: 14352717824.0000

Sentence: during the days of his prosperity, not a festivity took place without himself and wife being among the spectators.
Perplexity: 229764480.0000

Sentence: he dressed in the picturesque costume worn upon grand occasions by the inhabitants of the south of france, bearing equal resemblance to the style adopted both by the catalans and andalusians; while la carconte displayed the charming fashion prevalent among the women of arles, a mode of attire borrowed equally from greece and arabia.
Perplexity: 31681038.0000

Sentence: but, by degrees, watch-chains, necklaces, parti-colored scarves, embroidered bodices, velvet vests, elegantly worked stockings, striped gaiters, and silver buckles for the shoes, all disappeared; and gaspard caderousse, unable to appear abroad in his pristine splendor, had given up any further participation in the pomps and vanities, both for himself and wife, although a bitter feeling of envious discontent filled his mind as the sound of mirth and merry music from the joyous revellers reached even the miserable hostelry to which he still clung, more for the shelter than the profit it afforded.
Perplexity: 108544448.0000

Sentence: caderousse, then, was, as usual, at his place of observation before the door, his eyes glancing listlessly from a piece of closely shaven grass—on which some fowls were industriously, though fruitlessly, endeavoring to turn up some grain or insect suited to their palate—to the deserted road, which led away to the north and south, when he was aroused by the shrill voice of his wife, and grumbling to himself as he went, he mounted to her chamber, first taking care, however, to set the entrance door wide open, as an invitation to any chance traveller who might be passing.
Perplexity: 624873280.0000

Sentence: at the moment caderousse quitted his sentry-like watch before the door, the road on which he so eagerly strained his sight was void and lonely as a desert at midday.
Perplexity: 143498560.0000

Sentence: there it lay stretching out into one interminable line of dust and sand, with its sides bordered by tall, meagre trees, altogether presenting so uninviting an appearance, that no one in his senses could have imagined that any traveller, at liberty to regulate his hours for journeying, would choose to expose himself in such a formidable sahara.
Perplexity: 667142208.0000

Sentence: nevertheless, had caderousse but retained his post a few minutes longer, he might have caught a dim outline of something approaching from the direction of bellegarde; as the moving object drew nearer, he would easily have perceived that it consisted of a man and horse, between whom the kindest and most amiable understanding appeared to exist.
Perplexity: 38662356.0000

Sentence: the horse was of hungarian breed, and ambled along at an easy pace.
Perplexity: 33877144.0000

Sentence: his rider was a priest, dressed in black, and wearing a three-cornered hat; and, spite of the ardent rays of a noonday sun, the pair came on with a fair degree of rapidity.
Perplexity: 10379662336.0000

Sentence: having arrived before the pont du gard, the horse stopped, but whether for his own pleasure or that of his rider would have been difficult to say.
Perplexity: 113621120.0000

Sentence: however that might have been, the priest, dismounting, led his steed by the bridle in search of some place to which he could secure him.
Perplexity: 23847598.0000

Sentence: availing himself of a handle that projected from a half-fallen door, he tied the animal safely and having drawn a red cotton handkerchief, from his pocket, wiped away the perspiration that streamed from his brow, then, advancing to the door, struck thrice with the end of his iron-shod stick.
Perplexity: 150822976.0000

Sentence: at this unusual sound, a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring assailant of his ordinarily tranquil abode, snarling and displaying his sharp white teeth with a determined hostility that abundantly proved how little he was accustomed to society.
Perplexity: 64458312.0000

Sentence: at that moment a heavy footstep was heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the upper floor, and, with many bows and courteous smiles, the host of the pont du gard besought his guest to enter.
Perplexity: 486782656.0000

Sentence: 0319m “you are welcome, sir, most welcome!” repeated the astonished caderousse.
Perplexity: 203817248.0000

Sentence: “now, then, margotin,” cried he, speaking to the dog, “will you be quiet?
Perplexity: 95318280.0000

Sentence: pray don’t heed him, sir!—he only barks, he never bites.
Perplexity: 16029947904.0000

Sentence: i make no doubt a glass of good wine would be acceptable this dreadfully hot day.” then perceiving for the first time the garb of the traveller he had to entertain, caderousse hastily exclaimed: “a thousand pardons!
Perplexity: 205633376.0000

Sentence: i really did not observe whom i had the honor to receive under my poor roof.
Perplexity: 406694976.0000

Sentence: what would the abbé please to have?
Perplexity: 441099616.0000

Sentence: what refreshment can i offer?
Perplexity: 3986335488.0000

Sentence: all i have is at his service.” the priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching gaze—there even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper; then, observing in the countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded, he deemed it as well to terminate this dumb show, and therefore said, speaking with a strong italian accent, “you are, i presume, m. caderousse?” “yes, sir,” answered the host, even more surprised at the question than he had been by the silence which had preceded it; “i am gaspard caderousse, at your service.” “gaspard caderousse,” rejoined the priest.
Perplexity: 356566016.0000

Sentence: “yes,—christian and surname are the same.
Perplexity: 285239488.0000

Sentence: you formerly lived, i believe in the allées de meilhan, on the fourth floor?” 0325m “i did.” “and you followed the business of a tailor?” “true, i was a tailor, till the trade fell off.
Perplexity: 4783483904.0000

Sentence: it is so hot at marseilles, that really i believe that the respectable inhabitants will in time go without any clothing whatever.
Perplexity: 2998244608.0000

Sentence: but talking of heat, is there nothing i can offer you by way of refreshment?” “yes; let me have a bottle of your best wine, and then, with your permission, we will resume our conversation from where we left off.” “as you please, sir,” said caderousse, who, anxious not to lose the present opportunity of finding a customer for one of the few bottles of cahors still remaining in his possession, hastily raised a trap-door in the floor of the apartment they were in, which served both as parlor and kitchen.
Perplexity: 45242276.0000

Sentence: upon issuing forth from his subterranean retreat at the expiration of five minutes, he found the abbé seated upon a wooden stool, leaning his elbow on a table, while margotin, whose animosity seemed appeased by the unusual command of the traveller for refreshments, had crept up to him, and had established himself very comfortably between his knees, his long, skinny neck resting on his lap, while his dim eye was fixed earnestly on the traveller’s face.
Perplexity: 100719960.0000

Sentence: “are you quite alone?” inquired the guest, as caderousse placed before him the bottle of wine and a glass.
Perplexity: 97673472.0000

Sentence: “quite, quite alone,” replied the man—“or, at least, practically so, for my poor wife, who is the only person in the house besides myself, is laid up with illness, and unable to render me the least assistance, poor thing!” “you are married, then?” said the priest, with a show of interest, glancing round as he spoke at the scanty furnishings of the apartment.
Perplexity: 287256288.0000

Sentence: “ah, sir,” said caderousse with a sigh, “it is easy to perceive i am not a rich man; but in this world a man does not thrive the better for being honest.” the abbé fixed on him a searching, penetrating glance.
Perplexity: 33679292.0000

Sentence: “yes, honest—i can certainly say that much for myself,” continued the innkeeper, fairly sustaining the scrutiny of the abbé’s gaze; “i can boast with truth of being an honest man; and,” continued he significantly, with a hand on his breast and shaking his head, “that is more than everyone can say nowadays.” 0327m “so much the better for you, if what you assert be true,” said the abbé; “for i am firmly persuaded that, sooner or later, the good will be rewarded, and the wicked punished.” “such words as those belong to your profession,” answered caderousse, “and you do well to repeat them; but,” added he, with a bitter expression of countenance, “one is free to believe them or not, as one pleases.” “you are wrong to speak thus,” said the abbé; “and perhaps i may, in my own person, be able to prove to you how completely you are in error.” “what mean you?” inquired caderousse with a look of surprise.
Perplexity: 59277784.0000

Sentence: “in the first place, i must be satisfied that you are the person i am in search of.” “what proofs do you require?” “did you, in the year 1814 or 1815, know anything of a young sailor named dantès?” “dantès?
Perplexity: 25318520.0000

Sentence: did i know poor dear edmond?
Perplexity: 37181648.0000

Sentence: why, edmond dantès and myself were intimate friends!” exclaimed caderousse, whose countenance flushed darkly as he caught the penetrating gaze of the abbé fixed on him, while the clear, calm eye of the questioner seemed to dilate with feverish scrutiny.
Perplexity: 358022336.0000

Sentence: “you remind me,” said the priest, “that the young man concerning whom i asked you was said to bear the name of edmond.” “said to bear the name!” repeated caderousse, becoming excited and eager.
Perplexity: 62393448.0000

Sentence: “why, he was so called as truly as i myself bore the appellation of gaspard caderousse; but tell me, i pray, what has become of poor edmond?
Perplexity: 201310109696.0000

Sentence: did you know him?
Perplexity: 242452048.0000

Sentence: is he alive and at liberty?
Perplexity: 42609624.0000

Sentence: is he prosperous and happy?” “he died a more wretched, hopeless, heart-broken prisoner than the felons who pay the penalty of their crimes at the galleys of toulon.” a deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of caderousse, who turned away, and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes with the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head.
Perplexity: 160168512.0000

Sentence: “poor fellow, poor fellow!” murmured caderousse.
Perplexity: 1406477184.0000

Sentence: “well, there, sir, is another proof that good people are never rewarded on this earth, and that none but the wicked prosper.
Perplexity: 465616000.0000

Sentence: ah,” continued caderousse, speaking in the highly colored language of the south, “the world grows worse and worse.
Perplexity: 33931140.0000

Sentence: why does not god, if he really hates the wicked, as he is said to do, send down brimstone and fire, and consume them altogether?” “you speak as though you had loved this young dantès,” observed the abbé, without taking any notice of his companion’s vehemence.
Perplexity: 1655731200.0000

Sentence: “and so i did,” replied caderousse; “though once, i confess, i envied him his good fortune.
Perplexity: 110379176.0000

Sentence: but i swear to you, sir, i swear to you, by everything a man holds dear, i have, since then, deeply and sincerely lamented his unhappy fate.” there was a brief silence, during which the fixed, searching eye of the abbé was employed in scrutinizing the agitated features of the innkeeper.
Perplexity: 128390576.0000

Sentence: “you knew the poor lad, then?” continued caderousse.
Perplexity: 4783483904.0000

Sentence: “i was called to see him on his dying bed, that i might administer to him the consolations of religion.” “and of what did he die?” asked caderousse in a choking voice.
Perplexity: 2998244608.0000

Sentence: “of what, think you, do young and strong men die in prison, when they have scarcely numbered their thirtieth year, unless it be of imprisonment?” caderousse wiped away the large beads of perspiration that gathered on his brow.
Perplexity: 29594702.0000

Sentence: 0329m “but the strangest part of the story is,” resumed the abbé, “that dantès, even in his dying moments, swore by his crucified redeemer, that he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his detention.” “and so he was,” murmured caderousse.
Perplexity: 23467666.0000

Sentence: “how should he have been otherwise?
Perplexity: 49128764.0000

Sentence: ah, sir, the poor fellow told you the truth.” “and for that reason, he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he had never been able to penetrate, and to clear his memory should any foul spot or stain have fallen on it.” and here the look of the abbé, becoming more and more fixed, seemed to rest with ill-concealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was rapidly spreading over the countenance of caderousse.
Perplexity: 268470816.0000

Sentence: “a rich englishman,” continued the abbé, “who had been his companion in misfortune, but had been released from prison during the second restoration, was possessed of a diamond of immense value; this jewel he bestowed on dantès upon himself quitting the prison, as a mark of his gratitude for the kindness and brotherly care with which dantès had nursed him in a severe illness he underwent during his confinement.
Perplexity: 50424932.0000

Sentence: instead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers, who might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor, dantès carefully preserved it, that in the event of his getting out of prison he might have wherewithal to live, for the sale of such a diamond would have quite sufficed to make his fortune.” “then, i suppose,” asked caderousse, with eager, glowing looks, “that it was a stone of immense value?” “why, everything is relative,” answered the abbé.
Perplexity: 453472640.0000

Sentence: “to one in edmond’s position the diamond certainly was of great value.
Perplexity: 136889680.0000

Sentence: it was estimated at fifty thousand francs.” “bless me!” exclaimed caderousse, “fifty thousand francs!
Perplexity: 1284271360.0000

Sentence: surely the diamond was as large as a nut to be worth all that.” “no,” replied the abbé, “it was not of such a size as that; but you shall judge for yourself.
Perplexity: 130304520.0000

Sentence: i have it with me.” the sharp gaze of caderousse was instantly directed towards the priest’s garments, as though hoping to discover the location of the treasure.
Perplexity: 464009568.0000

Sentence: calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with black shagreen, the abbé opened it, and displayed to the dazzled eyes of caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained, set in a ring of admirable workmanship.
Perplexity: 469788192.0000

Sentence: “and that diamond,” cried caderousse, almost breathless with eager admiration, “you say, is worth fifty thousand francs?” “it is, without the setting, which is also valuable,” replied the abbé, as he closed the box, and returned it to his pocket, while its brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated innkeeper.
Perplexity: 204539648.0000

Sentence: “but how comes the diamond in your possession, sir?
Perplexity: 156055856.0000

Sentence: did edmond make you his heir?” “no, merely his testamentary executor.
Perplexity: 213538768.0000

Sentence: ‘i once possessed four dear and faithful friends, besides the maiden to whom i was betrothed’ he said; ‘and i feel convinced they have all unfeignedly grieved over my loss.
Perplexity: 377473184.0000

Sentence: the name of one of the four friends is caderousse.’” the innkeeper shivered.
Perplexity: 28254172.0000

Sentence: “‘another of the number,’” continued the abbé, without seeming to notice the emotion of caderousse, “‘is called danglars; and the third, in spite of being my rival, entertained a very sincere affection for me.’” a fiendish smile played over the features of caderousse, who was about to break in upon the abbé’s speech, when the latter, waving his hand, said, “allow me to finish first, and then if you have any observations to make, you can do so afterwards.
Perplexity: 161848016.0000

Sentence: ‘the third of my friends, although my rival, was much attached to me,—his name was fernand; that of my betrothed was’—stay, stay,” continued the abbé, “i have forgotten what he called her.” “mercédès,” said caderousse eagerly.
Perplexity: 1296963584.0000

Sentence: “true,” said the abbé, with a stifled sigh, “mercédès it was.” “go on,” urged caderousse.
Perplexity: 232437856.0000

Sentence: “bring me a _carafe_ of water,” said the abbé.
Perplexity: 157732848.0000

Sentence: caderousse quickly performed the stranger’s bidding; and after pouring some into a glass, and slowly swallowing its contents, the abbé, resuming his usual placidity of manner, said, as he placed his empty glass on the table: “where did we leave off?” “the name of edmond’s betrothed was mercédès.” “to be sure.
Perplexity: 883223360.0000

Sentence: ‘you will go to marseilles,’ said dantès,—for you understand, i repeat his words just as he uttered them.
Perplexity: 196487504.0000

Sentence: do you understand?” “perfectly.” “‘you will sell this diamond; you will divide the money into five equal parts, and give an equal portion to these good friends, the only persons who have loved me upon earth.’” “but why into five parts?” asked caderousse; “you only mentioned four persons.” “because the fifth is dead, as i hear.
Perplexity: 87902640.0000

Sentence: the fifth sharer in edmond’s bequest, was his own father.” “too true, too true!” ejaculated caderousse, almost suffocated by the contending passions which assailed him, “the poor old man did die.” “i learned so much at marseilles,” replied the abbé, making a strong effort to appear indifferent; “but from the length of time that has elapsed since the death of the elder dantès, i was unable to obtain any particulars of his end.
Perplexity: 128390576.0000

Sentence: can you enlighten me on that point?” “i do not know who could if i could not,” said caderousse.
Perplexity: 4783483904.0000

Sentence: “why, i lived almost on the same floor with the poor old man.
Perplexity: 2998244608.0000

Sentence: ah, yes, about a year after the disappearance of his son the poor old man died.” “of what did he die?” “why, the doctors called his complaint gastro-enteritis, i believe; his acquaintances say he died of grief; but i, who saw him in his dying moments, i say he died of——” caderousse paused.
Perplexity: 23089650.0000

Sentence: “of what?” asked the priest, anxiously and eagerly.
Perplexity: 100756272.0000

Sentence: “why, of downright starvation.” “starvation!” exclaimed the abbé, springing from his seat.
Perplexity: 71317144.0000

Sentence: “why, the vilest animals are not suffered to die by such a death as that.
Perplexity: 129820280.0000

Sentence: the very dogs that wander houseless and homeless in the streets find some pitying hand to cast them a mouthful of bread; and that a man, a christian, should be allowed to perish of hunger in the midst of other men who call themselves christians, is too horrible for belief.
Perplexity: 4783483904.0000

Sentence: oh, it is impossible!—utterly impossible!” “what i have said, i have said,” answered caderousse.
Perplexity: 2998244608.0000

Sentence: “and you are a fool for having said anything about it,” said a voice from the top of the stairs.
Perplexity: 41681524.0000

Sentence: “why should you meddle with what does not concern you?” the two men turned quickly, and saw the sickly countenance of la carconte peering between the baluster rails; attracted by the sound of voices, she had feebly dragged herself down the stairs, and, seated on the lower step, head on knees, she had listened to the foregoing conversation.
Perplexity: 25984170.0000

Sentence: “mind your own business, wife,” replied caderousse sharply.
Perplexity: 266009888.0000

Sentence: “this gentleman asks me for information, which common politeness will not permit me to refuse.” “politeness, you simpleton!” retorted la carconte.
Perplexity: 889551424.0000

Sentence: “what have you to do with politeness, i should like to know?
Perplexity: 99646832.0000

Sentence: better study a little common prudence.
Perplexity: 398070336.0000

Sentence: how do you know the motives that person may have for trying to extract all he can from you?” “i pledge you my word, madam,” said the abbé, “that my intentions are good; and that your husband can incur no risk, provided he answers me candidly.” “ah, that’s all very fine,” retorted the woman.
Perplexity: 130166160.0000

Sentence: “nothing is easier than to begin with fair promises and assurances of nothing to fear; but when poor, silly folks, like my husband there, have been persuaded to tell all they know, the promises and assurances of safety are quickly forgotten; and at some moment when nobody is expecting it, behold trouble and misery, and all sorts of persecutions, are heaped on the unfortunate wretches, who cannot even see whence all their afflictions come.” “nay, nay, my good woman, make yourself perfectly easy, i beg of you.
Perplexity: 152414080.0000

Sentence: whatever evils may befall you, they will not be occasioned by my instrumentality, that i solemnly promise you.” la carconte muttered a few inarticulate words, then let her head again drop upon her knees, and went into a fit of ague, leaving the two speakers to resume the conversation, but remaining so as to be able to hear every word they uttered.
Perplexity: 32822082.0000

Sentence: again the abbé had been obliged to swallow a draught of water to calm the emotions that threatened to overpower him.
Perplexity: 143144832.0000

Sentence: when he had sufficiently recovered himself, he said, “it appears, then, that the miserable old man you were telling me of was forsaken by everyone.
Perplexity: 21992454.0000

Sentence: surely, had not such been the case, he would not have perished by so dreadful a death.” “why, he was not altogether forsaken,” continued caderousse, “for mercédès the catalan and monsieur morrel were very kind to him; but somehow the poor old man had contracted a profound hatred for fernand—the very person,” added caderousse with a bitter smile, “that you named just now as being one of dantès’ faithful and attached friends.” “and was he not so?” asked the abbé.
Perplexity: 305043520.0000

Sentence: “gaspard, gaspard!” murmured the woman, from her seat on the stairs, “mind what you are saying!” caderousse made no reply to these words, though evidently irritated and annoyed by the interruption, but, addressing the abbé, said, “can a man be faithful to another whose wife he covets and desires for himself?
Perplexity: 216366416.0000

Sentence: but dantès was so honorable and true in his own nature, that he believed everybody’s professions of friendship.
Perplexity: 85408376.0000

Sentence: poor edmond, he was cruelly deceived; but it was fortunate that he never knew, or he might have found it more difficult, when on his deathbed, to pardon his enemies.
Perplexity: 42254168.0000

Sentence: and, whatever people may say,” continued caderousse, in his native language, which was not altogether devoid of rude poetry, “i cannot help being more frightened at the idea of the malediction of the dead than the hatred of the living.” “imbecile!” exclaimed la carconte.
Perplexity: 1555718144.0000

Sentence: “do you, then, know in what manner fernand injured dantès?” inquired the abbé of caderousse.
Perplexity: 59804272.0000

Sentence: “do i?

Perplexity: 101482424.0000

Perplexity: 2851194112.0000

Sentence: ask of me, as mayor, what is my opinion of m. morrel, and i shall say that he is a man honorable to the last degree, and who has up to this time fulfilled every engagement with scrupulous punctuality.

Sentence: 15, rue de nouailles; he has, i believe, two hundred thousand francs in morrel’s hands, and if there be any grounds for apprehension, as this is a greater amount than mine, you will most probably find him better informed than myself.” the englishman seemed to appreciate this extreme delicacy, made his bow and went away, proceeding with a characteristic british stride towards the street mentioned.

Perplexity: 441974656.0000

Sentence: the englishman appeared to reflect a moment, and then said, “from which it would appear, sir, that this credit inspires you with considerable apprehension?” “to tell you the truth, i consider it lost.” “well, then, i will buy it of you!” “you?” “yes, i!” “but at a tremendous discount, of course?” “no, for two hundred thousand francs.

Perplexity: 1250426624.0000

Sentence: i have since learned that he was confined in the château d’if, and i should like to learn some particulars of his death.” “what was his name?” “the abbé faria.” “oh, i recollect him perfectly,” cried m. de boville; “he was crazy.” “so they said.” “oh, he was, decidedly.” “very possibly; but what sort of madness was it?” “he pretended to know of an immense treasure, and offered vast sums to the government if they would liberate him.” “poor devil!—and he is dead?” “yes, sir, five or six months ago, last february.” “you have a good memory, sir, to recollect dates so well.” “i recollect this, because the poor devil’s death was accompanied by a singular incident.” “may i ask what that was?” said the englishman with an expression of curiosity, which a close observer would have been astonished at discovering in his phlegmatic countenance.
Perplexity: 49050864.0000

Sentence: “oh dear, yes, sir; the abbé’s dungeon was forty or fifty feet distant from that of one of bonaparte’s emissaries,—one of those who had contributed the most to the return of the usurper in 1815, a very resolute and very dangerous man.” “indeed!” said the englishman.
Perplexity: 72972608.0000

Perplexity: 365250880.0000

Sentence: it appears, sir, that this edmond dantès had procured tools, or made them, for they found a tunnel through which the prisoners held communication with one another.” “this tunnel was dug, no doubt, with an intention of escape?” “no doubt; but unfortunately for the prisoners, the abbé faria had an attack of catalepsy, and died.” “that must have cut short the projects of escape.” “for the dead man, yes,” replied m. de boville, “but not for the survivor; on the contrary, this dantès saw a means of accelerating his escape.
Perplexity: 772876352.0000

Sentence: he, no doubt, thought that prisoners who died in the château d’if were interred in an ordinary burial-ground, and he conveyed the dead man into his own cell, took his place in the sack in which they had sewed up the corpse, and awaited the moment of interment.” “it was a bold step, and one that showed some courage,” remarked the englishman.
Perplexity: 1239066368.0000

Sentence: “as i have already told you, sir, he was a very dangerous man; and, fortunately, by his own act disembarrassed the government of the fears it had on his account.” “how was that?” “how?
Perplexity: 131634472.0000

Sentence: do you not comprehend?” “no.” “the château d’if has no cemetery, and they simply throw the dead into the sea, after fastening a thirty-six-pound cannon-ball to their feet.” “well?” observed the englishman as if he were slow of comprehension.

Perplexity: 203280304.0000

Sentence: “so can i,” said the englishman, and he laughed too; but he laughed as the english do, “at the end of his teeth.” “and so,” continued the englishman who first gained his composure, “he was drowned?” “unquestionably.” “so that the governor got rid of the dangerous and the crazy prisoner at the same time?” “precisely.” 20027m “but some official document was drawn up as to this affair, i suppose?” inquired the englishman.
Perplexity: 103214128.0000

Perplexity: 187945120.0000

Sentence: so, sir, you wish to see all relating to the poor abbé, who really was gentleness itself.” “yes, you will much oblige me.” “go into my study here, and i will show it to you.” and they both entered m. de boville’s study.
Perplexity: 659676800.0000

Sentence: everything was here arranged in perfect order; each register had its number, each file of papers its place.
Perplexity: 136832512.0000

Sentence: the inspector begged the englishman to seat himself in an armchair, and placed before him the register and documents relative to the château d’if, giving him all the time he desired for the examination, while de boville seated himself in a corner, and began to read his newspaper.
Perplexity: 1092182016.0000

Sentence: the englishman easily found the entries relative to the abbé faria; but it seemed that the history which the inspector had related interested him greatly, for after having perused the first documents he turned over the leaves until he reached the deposition respecting edmond dantès.
Perplexity: 51038888.0000

Sentence: there he found everything arranged in due order,—the accusation, examination, morrel’s petition, m. de villefort’s marginal notes.
Perplexity: 1248753408.0000

Sentence: he folded up the accusation quietly, and put it as quietly in his pocket; read the examination, and saw that the name of noirtier was not mentioned in it; perused, too, the application dated 10th april, 1815, in which morrel, by the deputy procureur’s advice, exaggerated with the best intentions (for napoleon was then on the throne) the services dantès had rendered to the imperial cause—services which villefort’s certificates rendered indisputable.
Perplexity: 614435008.0000

Sentence: then he saw through the whole thing.
Perplexity: 295116864.0000

Perplexity: 783703872.0000

Sentence: he was no longer astonished when he searched on to find in the register this note, placed in a bracket against his name: edmond dantès.

Perplexity: 108660032.0000

Sentence: to be kept in strict solitary confinement, and to be closely watched and guarded.
Perplexity: 79122224.0000

Sentence: beneath these lines was written in another hand: “see note above—nothing can be done.” he compared the writing in the bracket with the writing of the certificate placed beneath morrel’s petition, and discovered that the note in the bracket was the same writing as the certificate—that is to say, was in villefort’s handwriting.
Perplexity: 49752648.0000

Sentence: 20029m as to the note which accompanied this, the englishman understood that it might have been added by some inspector who had taken a momentary interest in dantès’ situation, but who had, from the remarks we have quoted, found it impossible to give any effect to the interest he had felt.
Perplexity: 628968704.0000

Sentence: as we have said, the inspector, from discretion, and that he might not disturb the abbé faria’s pupil in his researches, had seated himself in a corner, and was reading _le drapeau blanc_.
Perplexity: 36202000.0000

Sentence: he did not see the englishman fold up and place in his pocket the accusation written by danglars under the arbor of la réserve, and which had the postmark, “marseilles, 27th february, delivery 6 o’clock, p.m.” but it must be said that if he had seen it, he attached so little importance to this scrap of paper, and so much importance to his two hundred thousand francs, that he would not have opposed whatever the englishman might do, however irregular it might be.
Perplexity: 239185840.0000

Sentence: “thanks,” said the latter, closing the register with a slam, “i have all i want; now it is for me to perform my promise.
Perplexity: 1290129280.0000

Sentence: give me a simple assignment of your debt; acknowledge therein the receipt of the cash, and i will hand you over the money.” he rose, gave his seat to m. de boville, who took it without ceremony, and quickly drew up the required assignment, while the englishman counted out the bank-notes on the other side of the desk.
Perplexity: 141762384.0000

Sentence: the house of morrel & son anyone who had quitted marseilles a few years previously, well acquainted with the interior of morrel’s warehouse, and had returned at this date, would have found a great change.
Perplexity: 294849056.0000

Sentence: instead of that air of life, of comfort, and of happiness that permeates a flourishing and prosperous business establishment—instead of merry faces at the windows, busy clerks hurrying to and fro in the long corridors—instead of the court filled with bales of goods, re-echoing with the cries and the jokes of porters, one would have immediately perceived all aspect of sadness and gloom.
Perplexity: 136946080.0000

Sentence: out of all the numerous clerks that used to fill the deserted corridor and the empty office, but two remained.
Perplexity: 187148128.0000

Sentence: one was a young man of three or four-and-twenty, who was in love with m. morrel’s daughter, and had remained with him in spite of the efforts of his friends to induce him to withdraw; the other was an old one-eyed cashier, called “cocles,” or “cock-eye,” a nickname given him by the young men who used to throng this vast now almost deserted bee-hive, and which had so completely replaced his real name that he would not, in all probability, have replied to anyone who addressed him by it.
Perplexity: 70024776.0000

Sentence: cocles remained in m. morrel’s service, and a most singular change had taken place in his position; he had at the same time risen to the rank of cashier, and sunk to the rank of a servant.
Perplexity: 191654208.0000

Sentence: he was, however, the same cocles, good, patient, devoted, but inflexible on the subject of arithmetic, the only point on which he would have stood firm against the world, even against m. morrel; and strong in the multiplication-table, which he had at his fingers’ ends, no matter what scheme or what trap was laid to catch him.
Perplexity: 148127984.0000

Sentence: in the midst of the disasters that befell the house, cocles was the only one unmoved.
Perplexity: 1375351296.0000

Sentence: but this did not arise from a want of affection; on the contrary, from a firm conviction.
Perplexity: 548078528.0000

Sentence: cocles had seen them go without thinking of inquiring the cause of their departure.
Perplexity: 222592608.0000

Sentence: everything was as we have said, a question of arithmetic to cocles, and during twenty years he had always seen all payments made with such exactitude, that it seemed as impossible to him that the house should stop payment, as it would to a miller that the river that had so long turned his mill should cease to flow.
Perplexity: 3092263168.0000

Sentence: nothing had as yet occurred to shake cocles’ belief; the last month’s payment had been made with the most scrupulous exactitude; cocles had detected an overbalance of fourteen sous in his cash, and the same evening he had brought them to m. morrel, who, with a melancholy smile, threw them into an almost empty drawer, saying: “thanks, cocles; you are the pearl of cashiers.” cocles went away perfectly happy, for this eulogium of m. morrel, himself the pearl of the honest men of marseilles, flattered him more than a present of fifty crowns.
Perplexity: 30356622.0000

Sentence: but since the end of the month m. morrel had passed many an anxious hour.
Perplexity: 36626644.0000

Sentence: in order to meet the payments then due; he had collected all his resources, and, fearing lest the report of his distress should get bruited abroad at marseilles when he was known to be reduced to such an extremity, he went to the beaucaire fair to sell his wife’s and daughter’s jewels and a portion of his plate.
Perplexity: 172049232.0000

Sentence: by this means the end of the month was passed, but his resources were now exhausted.
Perplexity: 160326832.0000

Sentence: credit, owing to the reports afloat, was no longer to be had; and to meet the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the present month, and the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the next month to m. de boville, m. morrel had, in reality, no hope but the return of the _pharaon_, of whose departure he had learnt from a vessel which had weighed anchor at the same time, and which had already arrived in harbor.
Perplexity: 647911488.0000

Sentence: but this vessel which, like the _pharaon_, came from calcutta, had been in for a fortnight, while no intelligence had been received of the _pharaon_.
Perplexity: 1335685632.0000

Sentence: 20033m such was the state of affairs when, the day after his interview with m. de boville, the confidential clerk of the house of thomson & french of rome, presented himself at m. morrel’s.

Sentence: emmanuel received him; this young man was alarmed by the appearance of every new face, for every new face might be that of a new creditor, come in anxiety to question the head of the house.
Perplexity: 1389380864.0000

Sentence: the young man, wishing to spare his employer the pain of this interview, questioned the new-comer; but the stranger declared that he had nothing to say to m. emmanuel, and that his business was with m. morrel in person.

Sentence: emmanuel sighed, and summoned cocles.
Perplexity: 515261184.0000

Perplexity: 79052232.0000

Perplexity: 51573980.0000

Perplexity: 429613696.0000

Sentence: morrel does not know my name; this worthy gentleman has only to announce the confidential clerk of the house of thomson & french of rome, with whom your father does business.” the young girl turned pale and continued to descend, while the stranger and cocles continued to mount the staircase.
Perplexity: 86180424.0000

Sentence: she entered the office where emmanuel was, while cocles, by the aid of a key he possessed, opened a door in the corner of a landing-place on the second staircase, conducted the stranger into an antechamber, opened a second door, which he closed behind him, and after having left the clerk of the house of thomson & french alone, returned and signed to him that he could enter.
Perplexity: 2061569536.0000

Perplexity: 202834544.0000

Sentence: fourteen years had changed the worthy merchant, who, in his thirty-sixth year at the opening of this history, was now in his fiftieth; his hair had turned white, time and sorrow had ploughed deep furrows on his brow, and his look, once so firm and penetrating, was now irresolute and wandering, as if he feared being forced to fix his attention on some particular thought or person.
Perplexity: 3368529664.0000

Sentence: the englishman looked at him with an air of curiosity, evidently mingled with interest.
Perplexity: 62288928.0000

Sentence: “monsieur,” said morrel, whose uneasiness was increased by this examination, “you wish to speak to me?” “yes, monsieur; you are aware from whom i come?” “the house of thomson & french; at least, so my cashier tells me.” “he has told you rightly.
Perplexity: 1271283712.0000

Sentence: the house of thomson & french had 300,000 or 400,000 francs to pay this month in france; and, knowing your strict punctuality, have collected all the bills bearing your signature, and charged me as they became due to present them, and to employ the money otherwise.” morrel sighed deeply, and passed his hand over his forehead, which was covered with perspiration.
Perplexity: 3324240640.0000

Sentence: “so then, sir,” said morrel, “you hold bills of mine?” “yes, and for a considerable sum.” “what is the amount?” asked morrel with a voice he strove to render firm.

Sentence: 20035m “here is,” said the englishman, taking a quantity of papers from his pocket, “an assignment of 200,000 francs to our house by m. de boville, the inspector of prisons, to whom they are due.
Perplexity: 517207808.0000

Sentence: you acknowledge, of course, that you owe this sum to him?” “yes; he placed the money in my hands at four and a half per cent nearly five years ago.” “when are you to pay?” “half the 15th of this month, half the 15th of next.” “just so; and now here are 32,500 francs payable shortly; they are all signed by you, and assigned to our house by the holders.” “i recognize them,” said morrel, whose face was suffused, as he thought that, for the first time in his life, he would be unable to honor his own signature.
Perplexity: 32029606.0000

Sentence: “is this all?” “no, i have for the end of the month these bills which have been assigned to us by the house of pascal, and the house of wild & turner of marseilles, amounting to nearly 55,000 francs; in all, 287,500 francs.” it is impossible to describe what morrel suffered during this enumeration.

Sentence: “two hundred and eighty-seven thousand five hundred francs,” repeated he.
Perplexity: 718085632.0000

Sentence: “i will not,” continued he, after a moment’s silence, “conceal from you, that while your probity and exactitude up to this moment are universally acknowledged, yet the report is current in marseilles that you are not able to meet your liabilities.” at this almost brutal speech morrel turned deathly pale.
Perplexity: 47661028.0000

Sentence: “sir,” said he, “up to this time—and it is now more than four-and-twenty years since i received the direction of this house from my father, who had himself conducted it for five-and-thirty years—never has anything bearing the signature of morrel & son been dishonored.” “i know that,” replied the englishman.
Perplexity: 37083204.0000

Sentence: “but as a man of honor should answer another, tell me fairly, shall you pay these with the same punctuality?” morrel shuddered, and looked at the man, who spoke with more assurance than he had hitherto shown.
Perplexity: 120079024.0000

Sentence: “to questions frankly put,” said he, “a straightforward answer should be given.
Perplexity: 480496128.0000

Sentence: yes, i shall pay, if, as i hope, my vessel arrives safely; for its arrival will again procure me the credit which the numerous accidents, of which i have been the victim, have deprived me; but if the _pharaon_ should be lost, and this last resource be gone——” the poor man’s eyes filled with tears.
Perplexity: 230548528.0000

Sentence: “well,” said the other, “if this last resource fail you?” “well,” returned morrel, “it is a cruel thing to be forced to say, but, already used to misfortune, i must habituate myself to shame.
Perplexity: 149286336.0000

Perplexity: 750707904.0000

Perplexity: 156675616.0000

Sentence: i dread almost as much to receive any tidings of my vessel as to remain in doubt.
Perplexity: 31092042.0000

Perplexity: 92702664.0000

Sentence: the _pharaon_ left calcutta the 5th of february; she ought to have been here a month ago.” “what is that?” said the englishman.
Perplexity: 26998708.0000

Sentence: “what is the meaning of that noise?” “oh, my god!” cried morrel, turning pale, “what is it?” a loud noise was heard on the stairs of people moving hastily, and half-stifled sobs.

Sentence: morrel rose and advanced to the door; but his strength failed him and he sank into a chair.
Perplexity: 683623872.0000

Perplexity: 342546016.0000

Perplexity: 36996520.0000

Sentence: the stranger fancied he heard footsteps on the stairs; and that the footsteps, which were those of several persons, stopped at the door.
Perplexity: 26089602.0000

Perplexity: 92891520.0000

Sentence: morrel rose tremblingly, supporting himself by the arm of the chair.
Perplexity: 84964648.0000

Perplexity: 122048184.0000

Sentence: “and the crew?” asked morrel.
Perplexity: 27295346.0000

Perplexity: 350431232.0000

Perplexity: 454400800.0000

Sentence: “how did this happen?” said morrel.
Perplexity: 310906336.0000

Perplexity: 219380432.0000

Sentence: “good-day, m. morrel,” said he, as if he had just quitted marseilles the previous evening, and had just returned from aix or toulon.
Perplexity: 84570464.0000

Sentence: “good-day, penelon,” returned morrel, who could not refrain from smiling through his tears, “where is the captain?” “the captain, m. morrel,—he has stayed behind sick at palma; but please god, it won’t be much, and you will see him in a few days all alive and hearty.” “well, now tell your story, penelon.” 20039m penelon rolled his quid in his cheek, placed his hand before his mouth, turned his head, and sent a long jet of tobacco-juice into the antechamber, advanced his foot, balanced himself, and began.
Perplexity: 85752632.0000

Sentence: “you see, m. morrel,” said he, “we were somewhere between cape blanc and cape boyador, sailing with a fair breeze, south-south-west after a week’s calm, when captain gaumard comes up to me—i was at the helm i should tell you—and says, ‘penelon, what do you think of those clouds coming up over there?’ i was just then looking at them myself.

Perplexity: 181308896.0000

Perplexity: 158840848.0000

Perplexity: 40655752.0000

Sentence: ‘well, penelon,’ said the captain, ‘what makes you shake your head?’ ‘why,’ i says, ‘i still think you’ve got too much on.’ ‘i think you’re right,’ answered he, ‘we shall have a gale.’ ‘a gale?
Perplexity: 907520256.0000

Sentence: more than that, we shall have a tempest, or i don’t know what’s what.’ you could see the wind coming like the dust at montredon; luckily the captain understood his business.

Sentence: ‘take in two reefs in the top-sails,’ cried the captain; ‘let go the bowlin’s, haul the brace, lower the top-gallant sails, haul out the reef-tackles on the yards.’” 20041m “that was not enough for those latitudes,” said the englishman; “i should have taken four reefs in the topsails and furled the spanker.” his firm, sonorous, and unexpected voice made everyone start.
Perplexity: 33047722.0000

Sentence: penelon put his hand over his eyes, and then stared at the man who thus criticized the manœuvres of his captain.
Perplexity: 5553184256.0000

Sentence: “we did better than that, sir,” said the old sailor respectfully; “we put the helm up to run before the tempest; ten minutes after we struck our top-sails and scudded under bare poles.” “the vessel was very old to risk that,” said the englishman.
Perplexity: 111587032.0000

Sentence: “eh, it was that that did the business; after pitching heavily for twelve hours we sprung a leak.
Perplexity: 48784672.0000

Perplexity: 119894568.0000

Sentence: ‘all hands to the pumps!’ i shouted; but it was too late, and it seemed the more we pumped the more came in.
Perplexity: 17442484.0000

Sentence: ‘ah,’ said i, after four hours’ work, ‘since we are sinking, let us sink; we can die but once.’ ‘is that the example you set, penelon?’ cries the captain; ‘very well, wait a minute.’ he went into his cabin and came back with a brace of pistols.
Perplexity: 326794208.0000

Sentence: ‘i will blow the brains out of the first man who leaves the pump,’ said he.” “well done!” said the englishman.

Sentence: 20043m “there’s nothing gives you so much courage as good reasons,” continued the sailor; “and during that time the wind had abated, and the sea gone down, but the water kept rising; not much, only two inches an hour, but still it rose.
Perplexity: 3158796800.0000

Sentence: ‘come,’ said the captain, ‘we have done all in our power, and m. morrel will have nothing to reproach us with, we have tried to save the ship, let us now save ourselves.

Sentence: to the boats, my lads, as quick as you can.’ now,” continued penelon, “you see, m. morrel, a sailor is attached to his ship, but still more to his life, so we did not wait to be told twice; the more so, that the ship was sinking under us, and seemed to say, ‘get along—save yourselves.’ we soon launched the boat, and all eight of us got into it.
Perplexity: 79317600.0000

Perplexity: 47127328.0000

Sentence: “as for that, m. morrel,” said he, again turning his quid, “as for that——” “as for what?” “the money.” “well——” “well, we all say that fifty francs will be enough for us at present, and that we will wait for the rest.” “thanks, my friends, thanks!” cried morrel gratefully; “take it—take it; and if you can find another employer, enter his service; you are free to do so.” these last words produced a prodigious effect on the seaman.

Perplexity: 81501128.0000

Perplexity: 362869824.0000

Sentence: when he thought the matter over, he could by no means account for this generous conduct on the part of thomson & french towards him; and could only attribute it to some such selfish argument as this: “we had better help a man who owes us nearly 300,000 francs, and have those 300,000 francs at the end of three months than hasten his ruin, and get only six or eight per cent of our money back again.” unfortunately, whether through envy or stupidity, all morrel’s correspondents did not take this view; and some even came to a contrary decision.

Perplexity: 739091840.0000

Sentence: morrel attributed penelon’s embarrassment to the elegance of his attire; it was evident the good fellow had not gone to such an expense on his own account; he was, no doubt, engaged on board some other vessel, and thus his bashfulness arose from the fact of his not having, if we may so express ourselves, worn mourning for the _pharaon_ longer.
Perplexity: 217849728.0000

Sentence: and morrel was right, for he returned home crushed by the humiliation of a refusal.
Perplexity: 252316128.0000

Sentence: the sport was bad; franz only succeeded in killing a few partridges, and, like every unsuccessful sportsman, he returned to the boat very much out of temper.
Perplexity: 133550920.0000

Sentence: “ah, if your excellency chose,” said the captain, “you might have capital sport.” “where?” “do you see that island?” continued the captain, pointing to a conical pile rising from the indigo sea.
Perplexity: 86952816.0000

Sentence: “well, what is this island?” “the island of monte cristo.” “but i have no permission to shoot over this island.” “your excellency does not require a permit, for the island is uninhabited.” “ah, indeed!” said the young man.
Perplexity: 95605240.0000

Sentence: “a desert island in the midst of the mediterranean must be a curiosity.” “it is very natural; this island is a mass of rocks, and does not contain an acre of land capable of cultivation.” “to whom does this island belong?” “to tuscany.” “what game shall i find there!” “thousands of wild goats.” “who live upon the stones, i suppose,” said franz with an incredulous smile.
Perplexity: 76541320.0000

Sentence: “no, but by browsing the shrubs and trees that grow out of the crevices of the rocks.” “where can i sleep?” “on shore in the grottos, or on board in your cloak; besides, if your excellency pleases, we can leave as soon as you like—we can sail as well by night as by day, and if the wind drops we can use our oars.” as franz had sufficient time, and his apartments at rome were not yet available, he accepted the proposition.
Perplexity: 120951584.0000

Sentence: upon his answer in the affirmative, the sailors exchanged a few words together in a low tone.
Perplexity: 116226856.0000

Sentence: “well,” asked he, “what now?
Perplexity: 1159603072.0000

Sentence: is there any difficulty in the way?” “no.” replied the captain, “but we must warn your excellency that the island is an infected port.” “what do you mean?” “monte cristo although uninhabited, yet serves occasionally as a refuge for the smugglers and pirates who come from corsica, sardinia, and africa, and if it becomes known that we have been there, we shall have to perform quarantine for six days on our return to leghorn.” “the deuce!
Perplexity: 286284352.0000

Sentence: that puts a different face on the matter.
Perplexity: 77801256.0000

Sentence: six days!
Perplexity: 513611776.0000

Sentence: why, that’s as long as the almighty took to make the world!
Perplexity: 125083152.0000

Sentence: too long a wait—too long.” “but who will say your excellency has been to monte cristo?” “oh, i shall not,” cried franz.
Perplexity: 38512288.0000

Sentence: “nor i, nor i,” chorused the sailors.
Perplexity: 88652080.0000

Sentence: “then steer for monte cristo.” the captain gave his orders, the helm was put up, and the boat was soon sailing in the direction of the island.
Perplexity: 26111308.0000

Sentence: franz waited until all was in order, and when the sail was filled, and the four sailors had taken their places—three forward, and one at the helm—he resumed the conversation.
Perplexity: 37125795840.0000

Sentence: “gaetano,” said he to the captain, “you tell me monte cristo serves as a refuge for pirates, who are, it seems to me, a very different kind of game from the goats.” “yes, your excellency, and it is true.” “i knew there were smugglers, but i thought that since the capture of algiers, and the destruction of the regency, pirates existed only in the romances of cooper and captain marryat.” “your excellency is mistaken; there are pirates, like the bandits who were believed to have been exterminated by pope leo xii., and who yet, every day, rob travellers at the gates of rome.
Perplexity: 392220384.0000

Sentence: has not your excellency heard that the french _chargé d’affaires_ was robbed six months ago within five hundred paces of velletri?” “oh, yes, i heard that.” “well, then, if, like us, your excellency lived at leghorn, you would hear, from time to time, that a little merchant vessel, or an english yacht that was expected at bastia, at porto-ferrajo, or at civita vecchia, has not arrived; no one knows what has become of it, but, doubtless, it has struck on a rock and foundered.
Perplexity: 158160048.0000

Sentence: now this rock it has met has been a long and narrow boat, manned by six or eight men, who have surprised and plundered it, some dark and stormy night, near some desert and gloomy island, as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses of a forest.” “but,” asked franz, who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the boat, “why do not those who have been plundered complain to the french, sardinian, or tuscan governments?” “why?” said gaetano with a smile.
Perplexity: 341455328.0000

Sentence: “yes, why?” “because, in the first place, they transfer from the vessel to their own boat whatever they think worth taking, then they bind the crew hand and foot, they attach to everyone’s neck a four-and-twenty-pound ball, a large hole is chopped in the vessel’s bottom, and then they leave her.
Perplexity: 74594464.0000

Sentence: at the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and settle down.
Perplexity: 37889040.0000

Sentence: first one gun’l goes under, then the other.
Perplexity: 107167584.0000

Sentence: then they lift and sink again, and both go under at once.
Perplexity: 382553344.0000

Sentence: all at once there’s a noise like a cannon—that’s the air blowing up the deck.
Perplexity: 36133156.0000

Sentence: soon the water rushes out of the scupper-holes like a whale spouting, the vessel gives a last groan, spins round and round, and disappears, forming a vast whirlpool in the ocean, and then all is over, so that in five minutes nothing but the eye of god can see the vessel where she lies at the bottom of the sea.
Perplexity: 207051776.0000

Sentence: do you understand now,” said the captain, “why no complaints are made to the government, and why the vessel never reaches port?” it is probable that if gaetano had related this previous to proposing the expedition, franz would have hesitated, but now that they had started, he thought it would be cowardly to draw back.
Perplexity: 368116960.0000

Sentence: he was one of those men who do not rashly court danger, but if danger presents itself, combat it with the most unalterable coolness.
Perplexity: 92319064.0000

Sentence: calm and resolute, he treated any peril as he would an adversary in a duel,—calculated its probable method of approach; retreated, if at all, as a point of strategy and not from cowardice; was quick to see an opening for attack, and won victory at a single thrust.
Perplexity: 72763432.0000

Sentence: “bah!” said he, “i have travelled through sicily and calabria—i have sailed two months in the archipelago, and yet i never saw even the shadow of a bandit or a pirate.” “i did not tell your excellency this to deter you from your project,” replied gaetano, “but you questioned me, and i have answered; that’s all.” “yes, and your conversation is most interesting; and as i wish to enjoy it as long as possible, steer for monte cristo.” the wind blew strongly, the boat made six or seven knots an hour, and they were rapidly reaching the end of their voyage.
Perplexity: 54048856.0000

Sentence: as they drew near the island seemed to lift from the sea, and the air was so clear that they could already distinguish the rocks heaped on one another, like cannon balls in an arsenal, with green bushes and trees growing in the crevices.
Perplexity: 1249148928.0000

Sentence: as for the sailors, although they appeared perfectly tranquil yet it was evident that they were on the alert, and that they carefully watched the glassy surface over which they were sailing, and on which a few fishing-boats, with their white sails, were alone visible.
Perplexity: 20757046.0000

Sentence: they were within fifteen miles of monte cristo when the sun began to set behind corsica, whose mountains appeared against the sky, showing their rugged peaks in bold relief; this mass of rock, like the giant adamastor, rose dead ahead, a formidable barrier, and intercepting the light that gilded its massive peaks so that the voyagers were in shadow.
Perplexity: 567306496.0000

Sentence: little by little the shadow rose higher and seemed to drive before it the last rays of the expiring day; at last the reflection rested on the summit of the mountain, where it paused an instant, like the fiery crest of a volcano, then gloom gradually covered the summit as it had covered the base, and the island now only appeared to be a gray mountain that grew continually darker; half an hour after, the night was quite dark.
Perplexity: 358314720.0000

Sentence: fortunately, the mariners were used to these latitudes, and knew every rock in the tuscan archipelago; for in the midst of this obscurity franz was not without uneasiness—corsica had long since disappeared, and monte cristo itself was invisible; but the sailors seemed, like the lynx, to see in the dark, and the pilot who steered did not evince the slightest hesitation.
Perplexity: 167830816.0000

Sentence: an hour had passed since the sun had set, when franz fancied he saw, at a quarter of a mile to the left, a dark mass, but he could not precisely make out what it was, and fearing to excite the mirth of the sailors by mistaking a floating cloud for land, he remained silent; suddenly a great light appeared on the strand; land might resemble a cloud, but the fire was not a meteor.
Perplexity: 58587400.0000

Sentence: “what is this light?” asked he.
Perplexity: 18165080.0000

Sentence: “hush!” said the captain; “it is a fire.” “but you told me the island was uninhabited?” “i said there were no fixed habitations on it, but i said also that it served sometimes as a harbor for smugglers.” “and for pirates?” “and for pirates,” returned gaetano, repeating franz’s words.
Perplexity: 139229824.0000

Sentence: “it is for that reason i have given orders to pass the island, for, as you see, the fire is behind us.” “but this fire?” continued franz.
Perplexity: 124741504.0000

Sentence: “it seems to me rather reassuring than otherwise; men who did not wish to be seen would not light a fire.” “oh, that goes for nothing,” said gaetano.
Perplexity: 142996368.0000

Sentence: “if you can guess the position of the island in the darkness, you will see that the fire cannot be seen from the side or from pianosa, but only from the sea.” “you think, then, this fire indicates the presence of unpleasant neighbors?” “that is what we must find out,” returned gaetano, fixing his eyes on this terrestrial star.
Perplexity: 45811300.0000

Sentence: “how can you find out?” “you shall see.” gaetano consulted with his companions, and after five minutes’ discussion a manœuvre was executed which caused the vessel to tack about, they returned the way they had come, and in a few minutes the fire disappeared, hidden by an elevation of the land.
Perplexity: 33080264.0000

Sentence: the pilot again changed the course of the boat, which rapidly approached the island, and was soon within fifty paces of it.
Perplexity: 369325184.0000

Sentence: gaetano lowered the sail, and the boat came to rest.
Perplexity: 45154688.0000

Sentence: all this was done in silence, and from the moment that their course was changed not a word was spoken.
Perplexity: 1091932032.0000

Sentence: gaetano, who had proposed the expedition, had taken all the responsibility on himself; the four sailors fixed their eyes on him, while they got out their oars and held themselves in readiness to row away, which, thanks to the darkness, would not be difficult.
Perplexity: 2290526976.0000

Sentence: as for franz, he examined his arms with the utmost coolness; he had two double-barrelled guns and a rifle; he loaded them, looked at the priming, and waited quietly.
Perplexity: 376998304.0000

Sentence: during this time the captain had thrown off his vest and shirt, and secured his trousers round his waist; his feet were naked, so he had no shoes and stockings to take off; after these preparations he placed his finger on his lips, and lowering himself noiselessly into the sea, swam towards the shore with such precaution that it was impossible to hear the slightest sound; he could only be traced by the phosphorescent line in his wake.
Perplexity: 93852856.0000

Sentence: this track soon disappeared; it was evident that he had touched the shore.
Perplexity: 417550656.0000

Sentence: everyone on board remained motionless for half an hour, when the same luminous track was again observed, and the swimmer was soon on board.
Perplexity: 118497744.0000

Sentence: “well?” exclaimed franz and the sailors in unison.
Perplexity: 131519528.0000

Sentence: “they are spanish smugglers,” said he; “they have with them two corsican bandits.” “and what are these corsican bandits doing here with spanish smugglers?” “alas,” returned the captain with an accent of the most profound pity, “we ought always to help one another.
Perplexity: 142556576.0000

Sentence: very often the bandits are hard pressed by gendarmes or carbineers; well, they see a vessel, and good fellows like us on board, they come and demand hospitality of us; you can’t refuse help to a poor hunted devil; we receive them, and for greater security we stand out to sea.
Perplexity: 381437152.0000

Sentence: this costs us nothing, and saves the life, or at least the liberty, of a fellow-creature, who on the first occasion returns the service by pointing out some safe spot where we can land our goods without interruption.” “ah!” said franz, “then you are a smuggler occasionally, gaetano?” “your excellency, we must live somehow,” returned the other, smiling impenetrably.
Perplexity: 44089584.0000

Sentence: “then you know the men who are now on monte cristo?” “oh, yes, we sailors are like freemasons, and recognize each other by signs.” “and do you think we have nothing to fear if we land?” “nothing at all; smugglers are not thieves.” “but these two corsican bandits?” said franz, calculating the chances of peril.
Perplexity: 531071072.0000

Sentence: “it is not their fault that they are bandits, but that of the authorities.” “how so?” “because they are pursued for having made a stiff, as if it was not in a corsican’s nature to revenge himself.” “what do you mean by having made a stiff?—having assassinated a man?” said franz, continuing his investigation.
Perplexity: 116553856.0000

Sentence: “i mean that they have killed an enemy, which is a very different thing,” returned the captain.
Perplexity: 1695403136.0000

Sentence: “well,” said the young man, “let us demand hospitality of these smugglers and bandits.
Perplexity: 200939632.0000

Sentence: do you think they will grant it?” “without doubt.” “how many are they?” “four, and the two bandits make six.” “just our number, so that if they prove troublesome, we shall be able to hold them in check; so, for the last time, steer to monte cristo.” “yes, but your excellency will permit us to take all due precautions.” “by all means, be as wise as nestor and as prudent as ulysses; i do more than permit, i exhort you.” “silence, then!” said gaetano.
Perplexity: 6176442880.0000

Sentence: everyone obeyed.
Perplexity: 341258720.0000

Sentence: for a man who, like franz, viewed his position in its true light, it was a grave one.
Perplexity: 49300452.0000

Sentence: he was alone in the darkness with sailors whom he did not know, and who had no reason to be devoted to him; who knew that he had several thousand francs in his belt, and who had often examined his weapons,—which were very beautiful,—if not with envy, at least with curiosity.
Perplexity: 85796144.0000

Sentence: on the other hand, he was about to land, without any other escort than these men, on an island which had, indeed, a very religious name, but which did not seem to franz likely to afford him much hospitality, thanks to the smugglers and bandits.
Perplexity: 220638496.0000

Sentence: the history of the scuttled vessels, which had appeared improbable during the day, seemed very probable at night; placed as he was between two possible sources of danger, he kept his eye on the crew, and his gun in his hand.
Perplexity: 120494744.0000

Sentence: the sailors had again hoisted sail, and the vessel was once more cleaving the waves.
Perplexity: 131286688.0000

Sentence: through the darkness franz, whose eyes were now more accustomed to it, could see the looming shore along which the boat was sailing, and then, as they rounded a rocky point, he saw the fire more brilliant than ever, and about it five or six persons seated.
Perplexity: 616780992.0000

Sentence: the blaze illumined the sea for a hundred paces around.
Perplexity: 41423704.0000

Sentence: gaetano skirted the light, carefully keeping the boat in the shadow; then, when they were opposite the fire, he steered to the centre of the circle, singing a fishing song, of which his companions sung the chorus.
Perplexity: 192893008.0000

Sentence: at the first words of the song the men seated round the fire arose and approached the landing-place, their eyes fixed on the boat, evidently seeking to know who the new-comers were and what were their intentions.
Perplexity: 54741484.0000

Sentence: they soon appeared satisfied and returned (with the exception of one, who remained at the shore) to their fire, at which the carcass of a goat was roasting.
Perplexity: 36607784.0000

Sentence: when the boat was within twenty paces of the shore, the man on the beach, who carried a carbine, presented arms after the manner of a sentinel, and cried, “who comes there?” in sardinian.
Perplexity: 333684896.0000

Sentence: franz coolly cocked both barrels.
Perplexity: 89273456.0000

Sentence: gaetano then exchanged a few words with this man which the traveller did not understand, but which evidently concerned him.
Perplexity: 142099952.0000

Sentence: “will your excellency give your name, or remain _incognito_?” asked the captain.
Perplexity: 55327316.0000

Sentence: “my name must rest unknown,” replied franz; “merely say i am a frenchman travelling for pleasure.” as soon as gaetano had transmitted this answer, the sentinel gave an order to one of the men seated round the fire, who rose and disappeared among the rocks.
Perplexity: 290739424.0000

Sentence: not a word was spoken, everyone seemed occupied, franz with his disembarkment, the sailors with their sails, the smugglers with their goat; but in the midst of all this carelessness it was evident that they mutually observed each other.
Perplexity: 131183808.0000

Sentence: the man who had disappeared returned suddenly on the opposite side to that by which he had left; he made a sign with his head to the sentinel, who, turning to the boat, said, “_s’accommodi_.” the italian _s’accommodi_ is untranslatable; it means at once, “come, enter, you are welcome; make yourself at home; you are the master.” it is like that turkish phrase of molière’s that so astonished the bourgeois gentleman by the number of things implied in its utterance.
Perplexity: 109085936.0000

Sentence: the sailors did not wait for a second invitation; four strokes of the oar brought them to land; gaetano sprang to shore, exchanged a few words with the sentinel, then his comrades disembarked, and lastly came franz.
Perplexity: 40502040.0000

Sentence: one of his guns was swung over his shoulder, gaetano had the other, and a sailor held his rifle; his dress, half artist, half dandy, did not excite any suspicion, and, consequently, no disquietude.
Perplexity: 129576368.0000

Sentence: the boat was moored to the shore, and they advanced a few paces to find a comfortable bivouac; but, doubtless, the spot they chose did not suit the smuggler who filled the post of sentinel, for he cried out: “not that way, if you please.” gaetano faltered an excuse, and advanced to the opposite side, while two sailors kindled torches at the fire to light them on their way.
Perplexity: 99748384.0000

Sentence: they advanced about thirty paces, and then stopped at a small esplanade surrounded with rocks, in which seats had been cut, not unlike sentry-boxes.
Perplexity: 549833408.0000

Sentence: around in the crevices of the rocks grew a few dwarf oaks and thick bushes of myrtles.
Perplexity: 264487584.0000

Sentence: franz lowered a torch, and saw by the mass of cinders that had accumulated that he was not the first to discover this retreat, which was, doubtless, one of the halting-places of the wandering visitors of monte cristo.
Perplexity: 753456448.0000

Sentence: as for his suspicions, once on _terra firma_, once that he had seen the indifferent, if not friendly, appearance of his hosts, his anxiety had quite disappeared, or rather, at sight of the goat, had turned to appetite.
Perplexity: 106879152.0000

Sentence: he mentioned this to gaetano, who replied that nothing could be more easy than to prepare a supper when they had in their boat, bread, wine, half a dozen partridges, and a good fire to roast them by.
Perplexity: 190884784.0000

Sentence: “besides,” added he, “if the smell of their roast meat tempts you, i will go and offer them two of our birds for a slice.” “you are a born diplomat,” returned franz; “go and try.” meanwhile the sailors had collected dried sticks and branches with which they made a fire.
Perplexity: 155460800.0000

Sentence: franz waited impatiently, inhaling the aroma of the roasted meat, when the captain returned with a mysterious air.
Perplexity: 146753104.0000

Sentence: “well,” said franz, “anything new?—do they refuse?” “on the contrary,” returned gaetano, “the chief, who was told you were a young frenchman, invites you to sup with him.” “well,” observed franz, “this chief is very polite, and i see no objection—the more so as i bring my share of the supper.” “oh, it is not that; he has plenty, and to spare, for supper; but he makes one condition, and rather a peculiar one, before he will receive you at his house.” “his house?
Perplexity: 91478408.0000

Sentence: has he built one here, then?” “no, but he has a very comfortable one all the same, so they say.” “you know this chief, then?” “i have heard talk of him.” “favorably or otherwise?” “both.” “the deuce!—and what is this condition?” “that you are blindfolded, and do not take off the bandage until he himself bids you.” franz looked at gaetano, to see, if possible, what he thought of this proposal.
Perplexity: 48299980.0000

Sentence: “ah,” replied he, guessing franz’s thought, “i know this is a serious matter.” “what should you do in my place?” “i, who have nothing to lose,—i should go.” 20075m “you would accept?” “yes, were it only out of curiosity.” “there is something very peculiar about this chief, then?” “listen,” said gaetano, lowering his voice, “i do not know if what they say is true”—he stopped to see if anyone was near.
Perplexity: 518461184.0000

Sentence: “what do they say?” “that this chief inhabits a cavern to which the pitti palace is nothing.” “what nonsense!” said franz, reseating himself.
Perplexity: 596159296.0000

Sentence: “it is no nonsense; it is quite true.
Perplexity: 1606899968.0000

Sentence: cama, the pilot of the _saint ferdinand_, went in once, and he came back amazed, vowing that such treasures were only to be heard of in fairy tales.” “do you know,” observed franz, “that with such stories you make me think of ali baba’s enchanted cavern?” “i tell you what i have been told.” “then you advise me to accept?” “oh, i don’t say that; your excellency will do as you please; i should be sorry to advise you in the matter.” franz pondered the matter for a few moments, concluded that a man so rich could not have any intention of plundering him of what little he had, and seeing only the prospect of a good supper, accepted.
Perplexity: 604667968.0000

Sentence: gaetano departed with the reply.
Perplexity: 117494672.0000

Sentence: franz was prudent, and wished to learn all he possibly could concerning his host.
Perplexity: 54874772.0000

Sentence: he turned towards the sailor, who, during this dialogue, had sat gravely plucking the partridges with the air of a man proud of his office, and asked him how these men had landed, as no vessel of any kind was visible.
Perplexity: 402676640.0000

Sentence: “never mind that,” returned the sailor, “i know their vessel.” “is it a very beautiful vessel?” “i would not wish for a better to sail round the world.” “of what burden is she?” “about a hundred tons; but she is built to stand any weather.
Perplexity: 63989028.0000

Sentence: she is what the english call a yacht.” “where was she built?” “i know not; but my own opinion is she is a genoese.” “and how did a leader of smugglers,” continued franz, “venture to build a vessel designed for such a purpose at genoa?” “i did not say that the owner was a smuggler,” replied the sailor.
Perplexity: 293983680.0000

Sentence: “no; but gaetano did, i thought.” “gaetano had only seen the vessel from a distance, he had not then spoken to anyone.” “and if this person be not a smuggler, who is he?” “a wealthy signor, who travels for his pleasure.” “come,” thought franz, “he is still more mysterious, since the two accounts do not agree.” “what is his name?” “if you ask him, he says sinbad the sailor; but i doubt if it be his real name.” “sinbad the sailor?” “yes.” “and where does he reside?” “on the sea.” “what country does he come from?” “i do not know.” “have you ever seen him?” “sometimes.” “what sort of a man is he?” “your excellency will judge for yourself.” “where will he receive me?” “no doubt in the subterranean palace gaetano told you of.” “have you never had the curiosity, when you have landed and found this island deserted, to seek for this enchanted palace?” “oh, yes, more than once, but always in vain; we examined the grotto all over, but we never could find the slightest trace of any opening; they say that the door is not opened by a key, but a magic word.” “decidedly,” muttered franz, “this is an arabian nights’ adventure.” “his excellency waits for you,” said a voice, which he recognized as that of the sentinel.
Perplexity: 770787392.0000

Sentence: he was accompanied by two of the yacht’s crew.
Perplexity: 127348672.0000

Sentence: franz drew his handkerchief from his pocket, and presented it to the man who had spoken to him.
Perplexity: 185973152.0000

Sentence: without uttering a word, they bandaged his eyes with a care that showed their apprehensions of his committing some indiscretion.
Perplexity: 173719072.0000

Sentence: afterwards he was made to promise that he would not make the least attempt to raise the bandage.
Perplexity: 106381888.0000

Sentence: he promised.
Perplexity: 259764512.0000

Sentence: then his two guides took his arms, and he went on, guided by them, and preceded by the sentinel.
Perplexity: 248055840.0000

Sentence: after going about thirty paces, he smelt the appetizing odor of the kid that was roasting, and knew thus that he was passing the bivouac; they then led him on about fifty paces farther, evidently advancing towards that part of the shore where they would not allow gaetano to go—a refusal he could now comprehend.
Perplexity: 88546800.0000

Sentence: presently, by a change in the atmosphere, he knew that they were entering a cave; after going on for a few seconds more he heard a crackling, and it seemed to him as though the atmosphere again changed, and became balmy and perfumed.
Perplexity: 83194240.0000

Sentence: at length his feet touched on a thick and soft carpet, and his guides let go their hold of him.
Perplexity: 80359792.0000

Perplexity: 32948218.0000

Sentence: i beg you will remove your bandage.” it may be supposed, then, franz did not wait for a repetition of this permission, but took off the handkerchief, and found himself in the presence of a man from thirty-eight to forty years of age, dressed in a tunisian costume, that is to say, a red cap with a long blue silk tassel, a vest of black cloth embroidered with gold, pantaloons of deep red, large and full gaiters of the same color, embroidered with gold like the vest, and yellow slippers; he had a splendid cashmere round his waist, and a small sharp and crooked cangiar was passed through his girdle.
Perplexity: 764277184.0000

Sentence: although of a paleness that was almost livid, this man had a remarkably handsome face; his eyes were penetrating and sparkling; his nose, quite straight, and projecting direct from the brow, was of the pure greek type, while his teeth, as white as pearls, were set off to admiration by the black moustache that encircled them.
Perplexity: 2002262016.0000

Sentence: his pallor was so peculiar, that it seemed to pertain to one who had been long entombed, and who was incapable of resuming the healthy glow and hue of life.

Perplexity: 167160896.0000

Perplexity: 61383728.0000

Sentence: the entire chamber was lined with crimson brocade, worked with flowers of gold.
Perplexity: 359921664.0000

Sentence: in a recess was a kind of divan, surmounted with a stand of arabian swords in silver scabbards, and the handles resplendent with gems; from the ceiling hung a lamp of venetian glass, of beautiful shape and color, while the feet rested on a turkey carpet, in which they sunk to the instep; tapestry hung before the door by which franz had entered, and also in front of another door, leading into a second apartment which seemed to be brilliantly illuminated.
Perplexity: 2523080704.0000

Sentence: the host gave franz time to recover from his surprise, and, moreover, returned look for look, not even taking his eyes off him.
Perplexity: 59951600.0000

Sentence: “sir,” he said, after a pause, “a thousand excuses for the precaution taken in your introduction hither; but as, during the greater portion of the year, this island is deserted, if the secret of this abode were discovered, i should doubtless, find on my return my temporary retirement in a state of great disorder, which would be exceedingly annoying, not for the loss it occasioned me, but because i should not have the certainty i now possess of separating myself from all the rest of mankind at pleasure.
Perplexity: 216351552.0000

Sentence: let me now endeavor to make you forget this temporary unpleasantness, and offer you what no doubt you did not expect to find here—that is to say, a tolerable supper and pretty comfortable beds.” “_ma foi_, my dear sir,” replied franz, “make no apologies.
Perplexity: 29870540.0000

Sentence: i have always observed that they bandage people’s eyes who penetrate enchanted palaces, for instance, those of raoul in the _huguenots_, and really i have nothing to complain of, for what i see makes me think of the wonders of the _arabian nights_.” 20079m “alas!
Perplexity: 375028896.0000

Sentence: i may say with lucullus, if i could have anticipated the honor of your visit, i would have prepared for it.
Perplexity: 72200208.0000

Perplexity: 38030076.0000

Sentence: ali, is the supper ready?” at this moment the tapestry moved aside, and a nubian, black as ebony, and dressed in a plain white tunic, made a sign to his master that all was prepared in the dining-room.
Perplexity: 691108544.0000

Sentence: “now,” said the unknown to franz, “i do not know if you are of my opinion, but i think nothing is more annoying than to remain two or three hours together without knowing by name or appellation how to address one another.

Perplexity: 48949176.0000

Sentence: as for myself, that i may put you at your ease, i tell you that i am generally called ‘sinbad the sailor.’” “and i,” replied franz, “will tell you, as i only require his wonderful lamp to make me precisely like aladdin, that i see no reason why at this moment i should not be called aladdin.
Perplexity: 3998252544.0000

Sentence: that will keep us from going away from the east whither i am tempted to think i have been conveyed by some good genius.” “well, then, signor aladdin,” replied the singular amphitryon, “you heard our repast announced, will you now take the trouble to enter the dining-room, your humble servant going first to show the way?” at these words, moving aside the tapestry, sinbad preceded his guest.
Perplexity: 143189328.0000

Sentence: franz now looked upon another scene of enchantment; the table was splendidly covered, and once convinced of this important point he cast his eyes around him.
Perplexity: 130216576.0000

Sentence: the dining-room was scarcely less striking than the room he had just left; it was entirely of marble, with antique bas-reliefs of priceless value; and at the four corners of this apartment, which was oblong, were four magnificent statues, having baskets in their hands.
Perplexity: 27102776.0000

Sentence: these baskets contained four pyramids of most splendid fruit; there were sicily pine-apples, pomegranates from malaga, oranges from the balearic isles, peaches from france, and dates from tunis.

Perplexity: 97351888.0000

Sentence: he remembers that i saved his life, and as he has a regard for his head, he feels some gratitude towards me for having kept it on his shoulders.” ali approached his master, took his hand, and kissed it.
Perplexity: 575137792.0000

Sentence: “would it be impertinent, signor sinbad,” said franz, “to ask you the particulars of this kindness?” 20081m “oh, they are simple enough,” replied the host.
Perplexity: 172775984.0000

Sentence: “it seems the fellow had been caught wandering nearer to the harem of the bey of tunis than etiquette permits to one of his color, and he was condemned by the bey to have his tongue cut out, and his hand and head cut off; the tongue the first day, the hand the second, and the head the third.
Perplexity: 18815664.0000

Sentence: i always had a desire to have a mute in my service, so learning the day his tongue was cut out, i went to the bey, and proposed to give him for ali a splendid double-barreled gun, which i knew he was very desirous of having.

Sentence: he hesitated a moment, he was so very desirous to complete the poor devil’s punishment.
Perplexity: 140375344.0000

Perplexity: 22128236.0000

Sentence: this was a useless clause in the bargain, for whenever the coward sees the first glimpse of the shores of africa, he runs down below, and can only be induced to appear again when we are out of sight of that quarter of the globe.” franz remained a moment silent and pensive, hardly knowing what to think of the half-kindness, half-cruelty, with which his host related the brief narrative.
Perplexity: 1054001600.0000

Sentence: “and like the celebrated sailor whose name you have assumed,” he said, by way of changing the conversation, “you pass your life in travelling?” “yes.
Perplexity: 219355328.0000

Sentence: i made a vow at a time when i little thought i should ever be able to accomplish it,” said the unknown with a singular smile; “and i made some others also which i hope i may fulfil in due season.” although sinbad pronounced these words with much calmness, his eyes gave forth gleams of extraordinary ferocity.
Perplexity: 107186400.0000

Sentence: “you have suffered a great deal, sir?” said franz inquiringly.
Perplexity: 52143708.0000

Sentence: sinbad started and looked fixedly at him, as he replied, “what makes you suppose so?” “everything,” answered franz,—“your voice, your look, your pallid complexion, and even the life you lead.” “i?—i live the happiest life possible, the real life of a pasha.
Perplexity: 352025600.0000

Sentence: i am king of all creation.
Perplexity: 22855584.0000

Sentence: sometimes i amuse myself by delivering some bandit or criminal from the bonds of the law.
Perplexity: 190811632.0000

Sentence: then i have my mode of dispensing justice, silent and sure, without respite or appeal, which condemns or pardons, and which no one sees.
Perplexity: 16237017.0000

Sentence: ah, if you had tasted my life, you would not desire any other, and would never return to the world unless you had some great project to accomplish there.” “revenge, for instance!” observed franz.
Perplexity: 41203384.0000

Sentence: the unknown fixed on the young man one of those looks which penetrate into the depth of the heart and thoughts.
Perplexity: 554347712.0000

Sentence: “and why revenge?” he asked.
Perplexity: 757843712.0000

Sentence: “because,” replied franz, “you seem to me like a man who, persecuted by society, has a fearful account to settle with it.” “ah!” responded sinbad, laughing with his singular laugh, which displayed his white and sharp teeth.
Perplexity: 34447272.0000

Sentence: “you have not guessed rightly.
Perplexity: 66377080.0000

Sentence: such as you see me i am, a sort of philosopher, and one day perhaps i shall go to paris to rival monsieur appert, and the man in the little blue cloak.” “and will that be the first time you ever took that journey?” “yes; it will.
Perplexity: 789415296.0000

Sentence: i must seem to you by no means curious, but i assure you that it is not my fault i have delayed it so long—it will happen one day or the other.” 20083m “and do you propose to make this journey very shortly?” “i do not know; it depends on circumstances which depend on certain arrangements.” “i should like to be there at the time you come, and i will endeavor to repay you, as far as lies in my power, for your liberal hospitality displayed to me at monte cristo.” “i should avail myself of your offer with pleasure,” replied the host, “but, unfortunately, if i go there, it will be, in all probability, _incognito_.” the supper appeared to have been supplied solely for franz, for the unknown scarcely touched one or two dishes of the splendid banquet to which his guest did ample justice.
Perplexity: 234854112.0000

Sentence: then ali brought on the dessert, or rather took the baskets from the hands of the statues and placed them on the table.
Perplexity: 161358848.0000

Sentence: between the two baskets he placed a small silver cup with a silver cover.
Perplexity: 24555282.0000

Sentence: the care with which ali placed this cup on the table roused franz’s curiosity.
Perplexity: 524206592.0000

Sentence: he raised the cover and saw a kind of greenish paste, something like preserved angelica, but which was perfectly unknown to him.
Perplexity: 175193472.0000

Sentence: he replaced the lid, as ignorant of what the cup contained as he was before he had looked at it, and then casting his eyes towards his host he saw him smile at his disappointment.
Perplexity: 72542688.0000

Sentence: “you cannot guess,” said he, “what there is in that small vase, can you?” “no, i really cannot.” “well, then, that green preserve is nothing less than the ambrosia which hebe served at the table of jupiter.” “but,” replied franz, “this ambrosia, no doubt, in passing through mortal hands has lost its heavenly appellation and assumed a human name; in vulgar phrase, what may you term this composition, for which, to tell the truth, i do not feel any particular desire?” “ah, thus it is that our material origin is revealed,” cried sinbad; “we frequently pass so near to happiness without seeing, without regarding it, or if we do see and regard it, yet without recognizing it.
Perplexity: 122629200.0000

Sentence: are you a man for the substantials, and is gold your god?
Perplexity: 127318320.0000

Sentence: are you a man of imagination—a poet?
Perplexity: 660934912.0000

Perplexity: 36760528.0000

Sentence: are you ambitious, and do you seek after the greatnesses of the earth?
Perplexity: 145387936.0000

Sentence: taste this, and in an hour you will be a king, not a king of a petty kingdom hidden in some corner of europe like france, spain, or england, but king of the world, king of the universe, king of creation; without bowing at the feet of satan, you will be king and master of all the kingdoms of the earth.
Perplexity: 1164825728.0000

Sentence: is it not tempting what i offer you, and is it not an easy thing, since it is only to do thus?
Perplexity: 103589440.0000

Sentence: look!” at these words he uncovered the small cup which contained the substance so lauded, took a teaspoonful of the magic sweetmeat, raised it to his lips, and swallowed it slowly with his eyes half shut and his head bent backwards.
Perplexity: 1016436480.0000

Sentence: franz did not disturb him whilst he absorbed his favorite sweetmeat, but when he had finished, he inquired: “what, then, is this precious stuff?” “did you ever hear,” he replied, “of the old man of the mountain, who attempted to assassinate philippe auguste?” “of course i have.” “well, you know he reigned over a rich valley which was overhung by the mountain whence he derived his picturesque name.
Perplexity: 113439648.0000

Sentence: in this valley were magnificent gardens planted by hassen-ben-sabah, and in these gardens isolated pavilions.
Perplexity: 737042176.0000

Sentence: into these pavilions he admitted the elect, and there, says marco polo, gave them to eat a certain herb, which transported them to paradise, in the midst of ever-blooming shrubs, ever-ripe fruit, and ever-lovely virgins.
Perplexity: 71100520.0000

Sentence: what these happy persons took for reality was but a dream; but it was a dream so soft, so voluptuous, so enthralling, that they sold themselves body and soul to him who gave it to them, and obedient to his orders as to those of a deity, struck down the designated victim, died in torture without a murmur, believing that the death they underwent was but a quick transition to that life of delights of which the holy herb, now before you, had given them a slight foretaste.” “then,” cried franz, “it is hashish!
Perplexity: 24375486.0000

Sentence: i know that—by name at least.” “that is it precisely, signor aladdin; it is hashish—the purest and most unadulterated hashish of alexandria,—the hashish of abou-gor, the celebrated maker, the only man, the man to whom there should be built a palace, inscribed with these words, _a grateful world to the dealer in happiness_.” “do you know,” said franz, “i have a very great inclination to judge for myself of the truth or exaggeration of your eulogies.” “judge for yourself, signor aladdin—judge, but do not confine yourself to one trial.
Perplexity: 240056944.0000

Sentence: like everything else, we must habituate the senses to a fresh impression, gentle or violent, sad or joyous.
Perplexity: 174981408.0000

Sentence: there is a struggle in nature against this divine substance,—in nature which is not made for joy and clings to pain.
Perplexity: 150926576.0000

Sentence: nature subdued must yield in the combat, the dream must succeed to reality, and then the dream reigns supreme, then the dream becomes life, and life becomes the dream.
Perplexity: 133844176.0000

Sentence: but what changes occur!
Perplexity: 44557172.0000

Sentence: it is only by comparing the pains of actual being with the joys of the assumed existence, that you would desire to live no longer, but to dream thus forever.
Perplexity: 1564991872.0000

Sentence: when you return to this mundane sphere from your visionary world, you would seem to leave a neapolitan spring for a lapland winter—to quit paradise for earth—heaven for hell!
Perplexity: 216592256.0000

Sentence: taste the hashish, guest of mine—taste the hashish.” franz’s only reply was to take a teaspoonful of the marvellous preparation, about as much in quantity as his host had eaten, and lift it to his mouth.
Perplexity: 32408154.0000

Sentence: “_diable!_” he said, after having swallowed the divine preserve.
Perplexity: 663047360.0000

Sentence: “i do not know if the result will be as agreeable as you describe, but the thing does not appear to me as palatable as you say.” “because your palate his not yet been attuned to the sublimity of the substances it flavors.
Perplexity: 614565120.0000

Sentence: tell me, the first time you tasted oysters, tea, porter, truffles, and sundry other dainties which you now adore, did you like them?
Perplexity: 588340160.0000

Sentence: could you comprehend how the romans stuffed their pheasants with assafœtida, and the chinese eat swallows’ nests?
Perplexity: 834816768.0000

Sentence: eh?
Perplexity: 27861904.0000

Sentence: no!
Perplexity: 223823408.0000

Sentence: well, it is the same with hashish; only eat for a week, and nothing in the world will seem to you to equal the delicacy of its flavor, which now appears to you flat and distasteful.
Perplexity: 66542632.0000

Sentence: let us now go into the adjoining chamber, which is your apartment, and ali will bring us coffee and pipes.” they both arose, and while he who called himself sinbad—and whom we have occasionally named so, that we might, like his guest, have some title by which to distinguish him—gave some orders to the servant, franz entered still another apartment.
Perplexity: 50943768.0000

Sentence: it was simply yet richly furnished.
Perplexity: 72866760.0000

Sentence: it was round, and a large divan completely encircled it.
Perplexity: 918596160.0000

Sentence: divan, walls, ceiling, floor, were all covered with magnificent skins as soft and downy as the richest carpets; there were heavy-maned lion-skins from atlas, striped tiger-skins from bengal; panther-skins from the cape, spotted beautifully, like those that appeared to dante; bear-skins from siberia, fox-skins from norway, and so on; and all these skins were strewn in profusion one on the other, so that it seemed like walking over the most mossy turf, or reclining on the most luxurious bed.
Perplexity: 322019968.0000

Sentence: both laid themselves down on the divan; chibouques with jasmine tubes and amber mouthpieces were within reach, and all prepared so that there was no need to smoke the same pipe twice.
Perplexity: 171485392.0000

Sentence: each of them took one, which ali lighted and then retired to prepare the coffee.
Perplexity: 26057822.0000

Sentence: there was a moment’s silence, during which sinbad gave himself up to thoughts that seemed to occupy him incessantly, even in the midst of his conversation; and franz abandoned himself to that mute reverie, into which we always sink when smoking excellent tobacco, which seems to remove with its fume all the troubles of the mind, and to give the smoker in exchange all the visions of the soul.
Perplexity: 551404544.0000

Sentence: ali brought in the coffee.
Perplexity: 40913704.0000

Sentence: “how do you take it?” inquired the unknown; “in the french or turkish style, strong or weak, sugar or none, cool or boiling?
Perplexity: 173017712.0000

Sentence: as you please; it is ready in all ways.” “i will take it in the turkish style,” replied franz.
Perplexity: 412962432.0000

Sentence: “and you are right,” said his host; “it shows you have a tendency for an oriental life.
Perplexity: 32865492.0000

Sentence: ah, those orientals; they are the only men who know how to live.
Perplexity: 806315840.0000

Sentence: as for me,” he added, with one of those singular smiles which did not escape the young man, “when i have completed my affairs in paris, i shall go and die in the east; and should you wish to see me again, you must seek me at cairo, bagdad, or ispahan.” 20087m “_ma foi_,” said franz, “it would be the easiest thing in the world; for i feel eagle’s wings springing out at my shoulders, and with those wings i could make a tour of the world in four-and-twenty hours.” “ah, yes, the hashish is beginning its work.
Perplexity: 26472314.0000

Sentence: well, unfurl your wings, and fly into superhuman regions; fear nothing, there is a watch over you; and if your wings, like those of icarus, melt before the sun, we are here to ease your fall.” he then said something in arabic to ali, who made a sign of obedience and withdrew, but not to any distance.
Perplexity: 354509248.0000

Sentence: as to franz a strange transformation had taken place in him.
Perplexity: 458859168.0000

Sentence: all the bodily fatigue of the day, all the preoccupation of mind which the events of the evening had brought on, disappeared as they do at the first approach of sleep, when we are still sufficiently conscious to be aware of the coming of slumber.
Perplexity: 29145718.0000

Sentence: his body seemed to acquire an airy lightness, his perception brightened in a remarkable manner, his senses seemed to redouble their power, the horizon continued to expand; but it was not the gloomy horizon of vague alarms, and which he had seen before he slept, but a blue, transparent, unbounded horizon, with all the blue of the ocean, all the spangles of the sun, all the perfumes of the summer breeze; then, in the midst of the songs of his sailors,—songs so clear and sonorous, that they would have made a divine harmony had their notes been taken down,—he saw the island of monte cristo, no longer as a threatening rock in the midst of the waves, but as an oasis in the desert; then, as his boat drew nearer, the songs became louder, for an enchanting and mysterious harmony rose to heaven, as if some loreley had decreed to attract a soul thither, or amphion, the enchanter, intended there to build a city.
Perplexity: 518155744.0000

Sentence: at length the boat touched the shore, but without effort, without shock, as lips touch lips; and he entered the grotto amidst continued strains of most delicious melody.
Perplexity: 85526072.0000

Sentence: he descended, or rather seemed to descend, several steps, inhaling the fresh and balmy air, like that which may be supposed to reign around the grotto of circe, formed from such perfumes as set the mind a-dreaming, and such fires as burn the very senses; and he saw again all he had seen before his sleep, from sinbad, his singular host, to ali, the mute attendant; then all seemed to fade away and become confused before his eyes, like the last shadows of the magic lantern before it is extinguished, and he was again in the chamber of statues, lighted only by one of those pale and antique lamps which watch in the dead of the night over the sleep of pleasure.
Perplexity: 446515424.0000

Sentence: they were the same statues, rich in form, in attraction, and poesy, with eyes of fascination, smiles of love, and bright and flowing hair.

Sentence: they were phryne, cleopatra, messalina, those three celebrated courtesans.
Perplexity: 225285632.0000

Sentence: then among them glided like a pure ray, like a christian angel in the midst of olympus, one of those chaste figures, those calm shadows, those soft visions, which seemed to veil its virgin brow before these marble wantons.
Perplexity: 150279104.0000

Sentence: then the three statues advanced towards him with looks of love, and approached the couch on which he was reposing, their feet hidden in their long white tunics, their throats bare, hair flowing like waves, and assuming attitudes which the gods could not resist, but which saints withstood, and looks inflexible and ardent like those with which the serpent charms the bird; and then he gave way before looks that held him in a torturing grasp and delighted his senses as with a voluptuous kiss.
Perplexity: 987643776.0000

Sentence: it seemed to franz that he closed his eyes, and in a last look about him saw the vision of modesty completely veiled; and then followed a dream of passion like that promised by the prophet to the elect.
Perplexity: 22281508.0000

Sentence: lips of stone turned to flame, breasts of ice became like heated lava, so that to franz, yielding for the first time to the sway of the drug, love was a sorrow and voluptuousness a torture, as burning mouths were pressed to his thirsty lips, and he was held in cool serpent-like embraces.
Perplexity: 45557388.0000

Sentence: the more he strove against this unhallowed passion the more his senses yielded to its thrall, and at length, weary of a struggle that taxed his very soul, he gave way and sank back breathless and exhausted beneath the kisses of these marble goddesses, and the enchantment of his marvellous dream.
Perplexity: 287530368.0000

Sentence: the waking when franz returned to himself, he seemed still to be in a dream.

Perplexity: 559350208.0000

Perplexity: 30686932.0000

Sentence: there for some time he enjoyed the fresh breeze which played on his brow, and listened to the dash of the waves on the beach, that left against the rocks a lace of foam as white as silver.
Perplexity: 348718304.0000

Sentence: he was for some time without reflection or thought for the divine charm which is in the things of nature, specially after a fantastic dream; then gradually this view of the outer world, so calm, so pure, so grand, reminded him of the illusiveness of his vision, and once more awakened memory.
Perplexity: 114713816.0000

Sentence: he recalled his arrival on the island, his presentation to a smuggler chief, a subterranean palace full of splendor, an excellent supper, and a spoonful of hashish.
Perplexity: 139586128.0000

Sentence: it seemed, however, even in the very face of open day, that at least a year had elapsed since all these things had passed, so deep was the impression made in his mind by the dream, and so strong a hold had it taken of his imagination.
Perplexity: 127483064.0000

Sentence: thus every now and then he saw in fancy amid the sailors, seated on a rock, or undulating in the vessel, one of the shadows which had shared his dream with looks and kisses.
Perplexity: 114285544.0000

Sentence: otherwise, his head was perfectly clear, and his body refreshed; he was free from the slightest headache; on the contrary, he felt a certain degree of lightness, a faculty for absorbing the pure air, and enjoying the bright sunshine more vividly than ever.
Perplexity: 251480592.0000

Sentence: he went gayly up to the sailors, who rose as soon as they perceived him; and the patron, accosting him, said: “the signor sinbad has left his compliments for your excellency, and desires us to express the regret he feels at not being able to take his leave in person; but he trusts you will excuse him, as very important business calls him to malaga.” “so, then, gaetano,” said franz, “this is, then, all reality; there exists a man who has received me in this island, entertained me right royally, and has departed while i was asleep?” “he exists as certainly as that you may see his small yacht with all her sails spread; and if you will use your glass, you will, in all probability, recognize your host in the midst of his crew.” so saying, gaetano pointed in a direction in which a small vessel was making sail towards the southern point of corsica.

Perplexity: 482459552.0000

Sentence: franz returned the salute by shaking his handkerchief as an exchange of signals.
Perplexity: 137835216.0000

Sentence: after a second, a slight cloud of smoke was seen at the stern of the vessel, which rose gracefully as it expanded in the air, and then franz heard a slight report.
Perplexity: 335670144.0000

Sentence: “there, do you hear?” observed gaetano; “he is bidding you adieu.” the young man took his carbine and fired it in the air, but without any idea that the noise could be heard at the distance which separated the yacht from the shore.
Perplexity: 631919616.0000

Sentence: “what are your excellency’s orders?” inquired gaetano.
Perplexity: 846013248.0000

Sentence: “in the first place, light me a torch.” “ah, yes, i understand,” replied the patron, “to find the entrance to the enchanted apartment.
Perplexity: 1148460928.0000

Sentence: with much pleasure, your excellency, if it would amuse you; and i will get you the torch you ask for.
Perplexity: 53528812.0000

Sentence: but i too have had the idea you have, and two or three times the same fancy has come over me; but i have always given it up.
Perplexity: 267291536.0000

Sentence: giovanni, light a torch,” he added, “and give it to his excellency.” giovanni obeyed.
Perplexity: 369080832.0000

Sentence: franz took the lamp, and entered the subterranean grotto, followed by gaetano.
Perplexity: 163774256.0000

Sentence: he saw nothing, unless that, by traces of smoke, others had before him attempted the same thing, and, like him, in vain.
Perplexity: 793660608.0000

Sentence: yet he did not leave a foot of this granite wall, as impenetrable as futurity, without strict scrutiny; he did not see a fissure without introducing the blade of his hunting sword into it, or a projecting point on which he did not lean and press in the hopes it would give way.
Perplexity: 109728448.0000

Sentence: all was vain; and he lost two hours in his attempts, which were at last utterly useless.
Perplexity: 1680493696.0000

Sentence: at the end of this time he gave up his search, and gaetano smiled.
Perplexity: 148250080.0000

Sentence: when franz appeared again on the shore, the yacht only seemed like a small white speck on the horizon.
Perplexity: 21258122.0000

Perplexity: 408489280.0000

Perplexity: 195557648.0000

Sentence: he took his fowling-piece, and began to hunt over the island with the air of a man who is fulfilling a duty, rather than enjoying a pleasure; and at the end of a quarter of an hour he had killed a goat and two kids.
Perplexity: 88928464.0000

Sentence: these animals, though wild and agile as chamois, were too much like domestic goats, and franz could not consider them as game.
Perplexity: 172646192.0000

Sentence: moreover, other ideas, much more enthralling, occupied his mind.
Perplexity: 98338008.0000

Perplexity: 81494600.0000

Sentence: franz was sitting on the spot where he was on the previous evening when his mysterious host had invited him to supper; and he saw the little yacht, now like a sea-gull on the wave, continuing her flight towards corsica.
Perplexity: 377724544.0000

Sentence: “why,” he remarked to gaetano, “you told me that signor sinbad was going to malaga, while it seems he is in the direction of porto-vecchio.” “don’t you remember,” said the patron, “i told you that among the crew there were two corsican brigands?” “true; and he is going to land them,” added franz.
Perplexity: 869444032.0000

Sentence: “precisely so,” replied gaetano.
Perplexity: 30521506.0000

Sentence: “ah, he is one who fears neither god nor satan, they say, and would at any time run fifty leagues out of his course to do a poor devil a service.” 20093m “but such services as these might involve him with the authorities of the country in which he practices this kind of philanthropy,” said franz.
Perplexity: 890211712.0000

Sentence: “and what cares he for that,” replied gaetano with a laugh, “or any authorities?
Perplexity: 80722792.0000

Sentence: he smiles at them.
Perplexity: 71406984.0000

Sentence: let them try to pursue him!
Perplexity: 183007872.0000

Sentence: why, in the first place, his yacht is not a ship, but a bird, and he would beat any frigate three knots in every nine; and if he were to throw himself on the coast, why, is he not certain of finding friends everywhere?” it was perfectly clear that the signor sinbad, franz’s host, had the honor of being on excellent terms with the smugglers and bandits along the whole coast of the mediterranean, and so enjoyed exceptional privileges.
Perplexity: 341712704.0000

Sentence: as to franz, he had no longer any inducement to remain at monte cristo.
Perplexity: 107123440.0000

Perplexity: 108395280.0000

Sentence: at the moment the boat began her course they lost sight of the yacht, as it disappeared in the gulf of porto-vecchio.
Perplexity: 177168352.0000

Sentence: with it was effaced the last trace of the preceding night; and then supper, sinbad, hashish, statues,—all became a dream for franz.
Perplexity: 168237552.0000

Sentence: the boat sailed on all day and all night, and next morning, when the sun rose, they had lost sight of monte cristo.
Perplexity: 133128736.0000

Perplexity: 13180746752.0000

Sentence: he set out, and on the saturday evening reached the place de la douane by the mail-coach.
Perplexity: 49955568.0000

Sentence: an apartment, as we have said, had been retained beforehand, and thus he had but to go to signor pastrini’s hotel.
Perplexity: 117732456.0000

Sentence: but this was not so easy a matter, for the streets were thronged with people, and rome was already a prey to that low and feverish murmur which precedes all great events; and at rome there are four great events in every year,—the carnival, holy week, corpus christi, and the feast of st. peter.
Perplexity: 75501408.0000

Sentence: all the rest of the year the city is in that state of dull apathy, between life and death, which renders it similar to a kind of station between this world and the next—a sublime spot, a resting-place full of poetry and character, and at which franz had already halted five or six times, and at each time found it more marvellous and striking.
Perplexity: 189746432.0000

Sentence: at last he made his way through the mob, which was continually increasing and getting more and more turbulent, and reached the hotel.
Perplexity: 88107264.0000

Sentence: on his first inquiry he was told, with the impertinence peculiar to hired hackney-coachmen and innkeepers with their houses full, that there was no room for him at the hôtel de londres.
Perplexity: 131976376.0000

Sentence: then he sent his card to signor pastrini, and asked for albert de morcerf.
Perplexity: 29431626.0000

Sentence: this plan succeeded; and signor pastrini himself ran to him, excusing himself for having made his excellency wait, scolding the waiters, taking the candlestick from the porter, who was ready to pounce on the traveller and was about to lead him to albert, when morcerf himself appeared.
Perplexity: 372129568.0000

Sentence: the apartment consisted of two small rooms and a parlor.
Perplexity: 60012696.0000

Sentence: the two rooms looked on to the street—a fact which signor pastrini commented upon as an inappreciable advantage.
Perplexity: 37764440.0000

Sentence: the rest of the floor was hired by a very rich gentleman who was supposed to be a sicilian or maltese; but the host was unable to decide to which of the two nations the traveller belonged.
Perplexity: 1056698944.0000

Sentence: “very good, signor pastrini,” said franz; “but we must have some supper instantly, and a carriage for tomorrow and the following days.” “as to supper,” replied the landlord, “you shall be served immediately; but as for the carriage——” “what as to the carriage?” exclaimed albert.
Perplexity: 68625464.0000

Sentence: “come, come, signor pastrini, no joking; we must have a carriage.” “sir,” replied the host, “we will do all in our power to procure you one—this is all i can say.” “and when shall we know?” inquired franz.
Perplexity: 85511880.0000

Sentence: “tomorrow morning,” answered the innkeeper.
Perplexity: 71197680.0000

Sentence: “oh, the deuce!
Perplexity: 29027106.0000

Sentence: then we shall pay the more, that’s all, i see plainly enough.
Perplexity: 611454976.0000

Sentence: at drake’s or aaron’s one pays twenty-five lire for common days, and thirty or thirty-five lire a day more for sundays and feast days; add five lire a day more for extras, that will make forty, and there’s an end of it.” “i am afraid if we offer them double that we shall not procure a carriage.” “then they must put horses to mine.
Perplexity: 35296264.0000

Sentence: it is a little worse for the journey, but that’s no matter.” “there are no horses.” albert looked at franz like a man who hears a reply he does not understand.
Perplexity: 68256816.0000

Sentence: “do you understand that, my dear franz—no horses?” he said, “but can’t we have post-horses?” “they have been all hired this fortnight, and there are none left but those absolutely requisite for posting.” “what are we to say to this?” asked franz.
Perplexity: 73604016.0000

Sentence: “i say, that when a thing completely surpasses my comprehension, i am accustomed not to dwell on that thing, but to pass to another.
Perplexity: 382527072.0000

Perplexity: 208863664.0000

Sentence: “be easy, my dear boy; they will come in due season; it is only a question of how much shall be charged for them.” morcerf then, with that delighted philosophy which believes that nothing is impossible to a full purse or well-lined pocketbook, supped, went to bed, slept soundly, and dreamed he was racing all over rome at carnival time in a coach with six horses.
Perplexity: 32395174.0000

Sentence: roman bandits the next morning franz woke first, and instantly rang the bell.
Perplexity: 39735708.0000

Sentence: the sound had not yet died away when signor pastrini himself entered.
Perplexity: 223865680.0000

Sentence: “well, excellency,” said the landlord triumphantly, and without waiting for franz to question him, “i feared yesterday, when i would not promise you anything, that you were too late—there is not a single carriage to be had—that is, for the three last days” “yes,” returned franz, “for the very three days it is most needed.” “what is the matter?” said albert, entering; “no carriage to be had?” “just so,” returned franz, “you have guessed it.” “well, your eternal city is a nice sort of place.” “that is to say, excellency,” replied pastrini, who was desirous of keeping up the dignity of the capital of the christian world in the eyes of his guest, “that there are no carriages to be had from sunday to tuesday evening, but from now till sunday you can have fifty if you please.” “ah, that is something,” said albert; “today is thursday, and who knows what may arrive between this and sunday?” “ten or twelve thousand travellers will arrive,” replied franz, “which will make it still more difficult.” “my friend,” said morcerf, “let us enjoy the present without gloomy forebodings for the future.” “at least we can have a window?” “where?” “in the corso.” “ah, a window!” exclaimed signor pastrini,—“utterly impossible; there was only one left on the fifth floor of the doria palace, and that has been let to a russian prince for twenty sequins a day.” the two young men looked at each other with an air of stupefaction.
Perplexity: 43438260.0000

Sentence: “well,” said franz to albert, “do you know what is the best thing we can do?
Perplexity: 83927536.0000

Sentence: it is to pass the carnival at venice; there we are sure of obtaining gondolas if we cannot have carriages.” “ah, the devil, no,” cried albert; “i came to rome to see the carnival, and i will, though i see it on stilts.” “bravo!
Perplexity: 414318656.0000

Sentence: an excellent idea.
Perplexity: 37977380.0000

Sentence: we will disguise ourselves as monster pulchinellos or shepherds of the landes, and we shall have complete success.” “do your excellencies still wish for a carriage from now to sunday morning?” “_parbleu!_” said albert, “do you think we are going to run about on foot in the streets of rome, like lawyers’ clerks?” “i hasten to comply with your excellencies’ wishes; only, i tell you beforehand, the carriage will cost you six piastres a day.” “and, as i am not a millionaire, like the gentleman in the next apartments,” said franz, “i warn you, that as i have been four times before at rome, i know the prices of all the carriages; we will give you twelve piastres for today, tomorrow, and the day after, and then you will make a good profit.” “but, excellency”—said pastrini, still striving to gain his point.
Perplexity: 425632672.0000

Sentence: “now go,” returned franz, “or i shall go myself and bargain with your _affettatore_, who is mine also; he is an old friend of mine, who has plundered me pretty well already, and, in the hope of making more out of me, he will take a less price than the one i offer you; you will lose the preference, and that will be your fault.” “do not give yourselves the trouble, excellency,” returned signor pastrini, with the smile peculiar to the italian speculator when he confesses defeat; “i will do all i can, and i hope you will be satisfied.” “and now we understand each other.” “when do you wish the carriage to be here?” “in an hour.” “in an hour it will be at the door.” an hour after the vehicle was at the door; it was a hack conveyance which was elevated to the rank of a private carriage in honor of the occasion, but, in spite of its humble exterior, the young men would have thought themselves happy to have secured it for the last three days of the carnival.
Perplexity: 60852272.0000

Sentence: “excellency,” cried the _cicerone_, seeing franz approach the window, “shall i bring the carriage nearer to the palace?” accustomed as franz was to the italian phraseology, his first impulse was to look round him, but these words were addressed to him.
Perplexity: 172818832.0000

Sentence: franz was the “excellency,” the vehicle was the “carriage,” and the hôtel de londres was the “palace.” the genius for laudation characteristic of the race was in that phrase.
Perplexity: 319636512.0000

Sentence: franz and albert descended, the carriage approached the palace; their excellencies stretched their legs along the seats; the _cicerone_ sprang into the seat behind.
Perplexity: 99195136.0000

Sentence: “where do your excellencies wish to go?” asked he.
Perplexity: 156300720.0000

Sentence: “to saint peter’s first, and then to the colosseum,” returned albert.
Perplexity: 42676484.0000

Sentence: but albert did not know that it takes a day to see saint peter’s, and a month to study it.
Perplexity: 680858624.0000

Sentence: the day was passed at saint peter’s alone.
Perplexity: 315563936.0000

Sentence: suddenly the daylight began to fade away; franz took out his watch—it was half-past four.
Perplexity: 859258944.0000

Sentence: they returned to the hotel; at the door franz ordered the coachman to be ready at eight.
Perplexity: 246077104.0000

Sentence: he wished to show albert the colosseum by moonlight, as he had shown him saint peter’s by daylight.
Perplexity: 682668736.0000

Sentence: when we show a friend a city one has already visited, we feel the same pride as when we point out a woman whose lover we have been.
Perplexity: 183718880.0000

Sentence: he was to leave the city by the porta del popolo, skirt the outer wall, and re-enter by the porta san giovanni; thus they would behold the colosseum without finding their impressions dulled by first looking on the capitol, the forum, the arch of septimus severus, the temple of antoninus and faustina, and the via sacra.
Perplexity: 122054936.0000

Sentence: they sat down to dinner.
Perplexity: 255738720.0000

Sentence: signor pastrini had promised them a banquet; he gave them a tolerable repast.
Perplexity: 190965280.0000

Sentence: at the end of the dinner he entered in person.
Perplexity: 1272477312.0000

Sentence: franz thought that he came to hear his dinner praised, and began accordingly, but at the first words he was interrupted.
Perplexity: 1828282752.0000

Sentence: “excellency,” said pastrini, “i am delighted to have your approbation, but it was not for that i came.” “did you come to tell us you have procured a carriage?” asked albert, lighting his cigar.
Perplexity: 1375288320.0000

Sentence: “no; and your excellencies will do well not to think of that any longer; at rome things can or cannot be done; when you are told anything cannot be done, there is an end of it.” “it is much more convenient at paris,—when anything cannot be done, you pay double, and it is done directly.” “that is what all the french say,” returned signor pastrini, somewhat piqued; “for that reason, i do not understand why they travel.” “but,” said albert, emitting a volume of smoke and balancing his chair on its hind legs, “only madmen, or blockheads like us, ever do travel.
Perplexity: 1061326528.0000

Sentence: men in their senses do not quit their hotel in the rue du helder, their walk on the boulevard de gand, and the café de paris.” it is of course understood that albert resided in the aforesaid street, appeared every day on the fashionable walk, and dined frequently at the only restaurant where you can really dine, that is, if you are on good terms with its waiters.
Perplexity: 79975992.0000

Sentence: signor pastrini remained silent a short time; it was evident that he was musing over this answer, which did not seem very clear.
Perplexity: 7042278400.0000

Sentence: “but,” said franz, in his turn interrupting his host’s meditations, “you had some motive for coming here, may i beg to know what it was?” 20099m “ah, yes; you have ordered your carriage at eight o’clock precisely?” “i have.” “you intend visiting _il colosseo_.” “you mean the colosseum?” “it is the same thing.
Perplexity: 281073920.0000

Sentence: you have told your coachman to leave the city by the porta del popolo, to drive round the walls, and re-enter by the porta san giovanni?” “these are my words exactly.” “well, this route is impossible.” “impossible!” “very dangerous, to say the least.” “dangerous!—and why?” “on account of the famous luigi vampa.” “pray, who may this famous luigi vampa be?” inquired albert; “he may be very famous at rome, but i can assure you he is quite unknown at paris.” “what!
Perplexity: 57428140.0000

Sentence: do you not know him?” “i have not that honor.” “you have never heard his name?” “never.” “well, then, he is a bandit, compared to whom the decesaris and the gasparones were mere children.” “now then, albert,” cried franz, “here is a bandit for you at last.” “i forewarn you, signor pastrini, that i shall not believe one word of what you are going to tell us; having told you this, begin.
Perplexity: 619440704.0000

Sentence: ‘once upon a time——’ well, go on.” signor pastrini turned toward franz, who seemed to him the more reasonable of the two; we must do him justice,—he had had a great many frenchmen in his house, but had never been able to comprehend them.
Perplexity: 386647360.0000

Sentence: “excellency,” said he gravely, addressing franz, “if you look upon me as a liar, it is useless for me to say anything; it was for your interest i——” “albert does not say you are a liar, signor pastrini,” said franz, “but that he will not believe what you are going to tell us,—but i will believe all you say; so proceed.” “but if your excellency doubt my veracity——” “signor pastrini,” returned franz, “you are more susceptible than cassandra, who was a prophetess, and yet no one believed her; while you, at least, are sure of the credence of half your audience.
Perplexity: 26266906.0000

Sentence: come, sit down, and tell us all about this signor vampa.” “i had told your excellency he is the most famous bandit we have had since the days of mastrilla.” “well, what has this bandit to do with the order i have given the coachman to leave the city by the porta del popolo, and to re-enter by the porta san giovanni?” 20101m “this,” replied signor pastrini, “that you will go out by one, but i very much doubt your returning by the other.” “why?” asked franz.
Perplexity: 74194456.0000

Sentence: “because, after nightfall, you are not safe fifty yards from the gates.” “on your honor, is that true?” cried albert.
Perplexity: 1051714368.0000

Sentence: “count,” returned signor pastrini, hurt at albert’s repeated doubts of the truth of his assertions, “i do not say this to you, but to your companion, who knows rome, and knows, too, that these things are not to be laughed at.” “my dear fellow,” said albert, turning to franz, “here is an admirable adventure; we will fill our carriage with pistols, blunderbusses, and double-barrelled guns.
Perplexity: 100195344.0000

Sentence: luigi vampa comes to take us, and we take him—we bring him back to rome, and present him to his holiness the pope, who asks how he can repay so great a service; then we merely ask for a carriage and a pair of horses, and we see the carnival in the carriage, and doubtless the roman people will crown us at the capitol, and proclaim us, like curtius and horatius cocles, the preservers of their country.” whilst albert proposed this scheme, signor pastrini’s face assumed an expression impossible to describe.
Perplexity: 20458872.0000

Sentence: “and pray,” asked franz, “where are these pistols, blunderbusses, and other deadly weapons with which you intend filling the carriage?” “not out of my armory, for at terracina i was plundered even of my hunting-knife.
Perplexity: 872259520.0000

Sentence: and you?” “i shared the same fate at aquapendente.” “do you know, signor pastrini,” said albert, lighting a second cigar at the first, “that this practice is very convenient for bandits, and that it seems to be due to an arrangement of their own.” doubtless signor pastrini found this pleasantry compromising, for he only answered half the question, and then he spoke to franz, as the only one likely to listen with attention.
Perplexity: 47193440.0000

Sentence: “your excellency knows that it is not customary to defend yourself when attacked by bandits.” “what!” cried albert, whose courage revolted at the idea of being plundered tamely, “not make any resistance!” “no, for it would be useless.

Perplexity: 28685536.0000

Perplexity: 173920304.0000

Perplexity: 134171080.0000

Sentence: “the explanation would be too long, my dear landlord,” replied franz.
Perplexity: 546565888.0000

Sentence: “and you say that signor vampa exercises his profession at this moment in the environs of rome?” “and with a boldness of which no bandit before him ever gave an example.” “then the police have vainly tried to lay hands on him?” “why, you see, he has a good understanding with the shepherds in the plains, the fishermen of the tiber, and the smugglers of the coast.
Perplexity: 342949376.0000

Sentence: they seek for him in the mountains, and he is on the waters; they follow him on the waters, and he is on the open sea; then they pursue him, and he has suddenly taken refuge in the islands, at giglio, giannutri, or monte cristo; and when they hunt for him there, he reappears suddenly at albano, tivoli, or la riccia.” “and how does he behave towards travellers?” “alas!
Perplexity: 726625024.0000

Sentence: his plan is very simple.
Perplexity: 852673024.0000

Sentence: it depends on the distance he may be from the city, whether he gives eight hours, twelve hours, or a day wherein to pay their ransom; and when that time has elapsed he allows another hour’s grace.
Perplexity: 104575688.0000

Sentence: at the sixtieth minute of this hour, if the money is not forthcoming, he blows out the prisoner’s brains with a pistol-shot, or plants his dagger in his heart, and that settles the account.” “well, albert,” inquired franz of his companion, “are you still disposed to go to the colosseum by the outer wall?” “quite so,” said albert, “if the way be picturesque.” the clock struck nine as the door opened, and a coachman appeared.
Perplexity: 79511784.0000

Sentence: “excellencies,” said he, “the coach is ready.” “well, then,” said franz, “let us to the colosseum.” “by the porta del popolo or by the streets, your excellencies?” “by the streets, _morbleu!_ by the streets!” cried franz.
Perplexity: 1393778816.0000

Sentence: “ah, my dear fellow,” said albert, rising, and lighting his third cigar, “really, i thought you had more courage.” so saying, the two young men went down the staircase, and got into the carriage.
Perplexity: 121067448.0000

Sentence: the colosseum franz had so managed his route, that during the ride to the colosseum they passed not a single ancient ruin, so that no preliminary impression interfered to mitigate the colossal proportions of the gigantic building they came to admire.
Perplexity: 143382288.0000

Sentence: the road selected was a continuation of the via sistina; then by cutting off the right angle of the street in which stands santa maria maggiore and proceeding by the via urbana and san pietro in vincoli, the travellers would find themselves directly opposite the colosseum.
Perplexity: 44121384.0000

Sentence: this itinerary possessed another great advantage,—that of leaving franz at full liberty to indulge his deep reverie upon the subject of signor pastrini’s story, in which his mysterious host of monte cristo was so strangely mixed up.
Perplexity: 109845304.0000

Sentence: seated with folded arms in a corner of the carriage, he continued to ponder over the singular history he had so lately listened to, and to ask himself an interminable number of questions touching its various circumstances without, however, arriving at a satisfactory reply to any of them.
Perplexity: 174993408.0000

Sentence: one fact more than the rest brought his friend “sinbad the sailor” back to his recollection, and that was the mysterious sort of intimacy that seemed to exist between the brigands and the sailors; and pastrini’s account of vampa’s having found refuge on board the vessels of smugglers and fishermen, reminded franz of the two corsican bandits he had found supping so amicably with the crew of the little yacht, which had even deviated from its course and touched at porto-vecchio for the sole purpose of landing them.
Perplexity: 62832448.0000

Sentence: the very name assumed by his host of monte cristo and again repeated by the landlord of the hôtel de londres, abundantly proved to him that his island friend was playing his philanthropic part on the shores of piombino, civita vecchia, ostia, and gaëta, as on those of corsica, tuscany, and spain; and further, franz bethought him of having heard his singular entertainer speak both of tunis and palermo, proving thereby how largely his circle of acquaintances extended.
Perplexity: 1072674432.0000

Sentence: but however the mind of the young man might be absorbed in these reflections, they were at once dispersed at the sight of the dark frowning ruins of the stupendous colosseum, through the various openings of which the pale moonlight played and flickered like the unearthly gleam from the eyes of the wandering dead.
Perplexity: 312764416.0000

Sentence: the carriage stopped near the meta sudans; the door was opened, and the young men, eagerly alighting, found themselves opposite a _cicerone_, who appeared to have sprung up from the ground, so unexpected was his appearance.
Perplexity: 20934812.0000

Sentence: the usual guide from the hotel having followed them, they had paid two conductors, nor is it possible, at rome, to avoid this abundant supply of guides; besides the ordinary _cicerone_, who seizes upon you directly you set foot in your hotel, and never quits you while you remain in the city, there is also a special _cicerone_ belonging to each monument—nay, almost to each part of a monument.
Perplexity: 1164101760.0000

Sentence: it may, therefore, be easily imagined there is no scarcity of guides at the colosseum, that wonder of all ages, which martial thus eulogizes: “let memphis cease to boast the barbarous miracles of her pyramids, and the wonders of babylon be talked of no more among us; all must bow to the superiority of the gigantic labor of the cæsars, and the many voices of fame spread far and wide the surpassing merits of this incomparable monument.” as for albert and franz, they essayed not to escape from their _ciceronian_ tyrants; and, indeed, it would have been so much the more difficult to break their bondage, as the guides alone are permitted to visit these monuments with torches in their hands.
Perplexity: 500577440.0000

Sentence: thus, then, the young men made no attempt at resistance, but blindly and confidingly surrendered themselves into the care and custody of their conductors.
Perplexity: 343025248.0000

Sentence: franz had already made seven or eight similar excursions to the colosseum, while his less favored companion trod for the first time in his life the classic ground forming the monument of flavius vespasian; and, to his credit be it spoken, his mind, even amid the glib loquacity of the guides, was duly and deeply touched with awe and enthusiastic admiration of all he saw; and certainly no adequate notion of these stupendous ruins can be formed save by such as have visited them, and more especially by moonlight, at which time the vast proportions of the building appear twice as large when viewed by the mysterious beams of a southern moonlit sky, whose rays are sufficiently clear and vivid to light the horizon with a glow equal to the soft twilight of a western clime.
Perplexity: 503009408.0000

Sentence: scarcely, therefore, had the reflective franz walked a hundred steps beneath the interior porticoes of the ruin, when, abandoning albert to the guides (who would by no means yield their prescriptive right of carrying their victims through the routine regularly laid down, and as regularly followed by them, but dragged the unconscious visitor to the various objects with a pertinacity that admitted of no appeal, beginning, as a matter of course, with the “lions’ den”, the “hall of the gladiators” and finishing with “cæsar’s podium”), to escape a jargon and mechanical survey of the wonders by which he was surrounded, franz ascended a half-dilapidated staircase, and, leaving them to follow their monotonous round, seated himself at the foot of a column, and immediately opposite a large aperture, which permitted him to enjoy a full and undisturbed view of the gigantic dimensions of the majestic ruin.
Perplexity: 108707088.0000

Sentence: franz had remained for nearly a quarter of an hour perfectly hidden by the shadow of the vast column at whose base he had found a resting-place, and from whence his eyes followed the motions of albert and his guides, who, holding torches in their hands, had emerged from a vomitorium at the opposite extremity of the colosseum, and then again disappeared down the steps conducting to the seats reserved for the vestal virgins, resembling, as they glided along, some restless shades following the flickering glare of so many _ignes fatui_.
Perplexity: 26746940.0000

Sentence: all at once his ear caught a sound resembling that of a stone rolling down the staircase opposite the one by which he had himself ascended.
Perplexity: 78386344.0000

Sentence: there was nothing remarkable in the circumstance of a fragment of granite giving way and falling heavily below; but it seemed to him that the substance that fell gave way beneath the pressure of a foot, and also that someone, who endeavored as much as possible to prevent his footsteps from being heard, was approaching the spot where he sat.
Perplexity: 1351054080.0000

Sentence: conjecture soon became certainty, for the figure of a man was distinctly visible to franz, gradually emerging from the staircase opposite, upon which the moon was at that moment pouring a full tide of silvery brightness.
Perplexity: 180142752.0000

Sentence: the stranger thus presenting himself was probably a person who, like franz, preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own thoughts to the frivolous gabble of the guides.
Perplexity: 182103248.0000

Sentence: and his appearance had nothing extraordinary in it; but the hesitation with which he proceeded, stopping and listening with anxious attention at every step he took, convinced franz that he expected the arrival of some person.
Perplexity: 397897248.0000

Sentence: by a sort of instinctive impulse, franz withdrew as much as possible behind his pillar.
Perplexity: 98039480.0000

Sentence: about ten feet from the spot where he and the stranger were, the roof had given way, leaving a large round opening, through which might be seen the blue vault of heaven, thickly studded with stars.
Perplexity: 3639776768.0000

Sentence: around this opening, which had, possibly, for ages permitted a free entrance to the brilliant moonbeams that now illumined the vast pile, grew a quantity of creeping plants, whose delicate green branches stood out in bold relief against the clear azure of the firmament, while large masses of thick, strong fibrous shoots forced their way through the chasm, and hung floating to and fro, like so many waving strings.
Perplexity: 794186112.0000

Sentence: the person whose mysterious arrival had attracted the attention of franz stood in a kind of half-light, that rendered it impossible to distinguish his features, although his dress was easily made out.
Perplexity: 415971168.0000

Sentence: he wore a large brown mantle, one fold of which, thrown over his left shoulder, served likewise to mask the lower part of his countenance, while the upper part was completely hidden by his broad-brimmed hat.
Perplexity: 36589076.0000

Sentence: the lower part of his dress was more distinctly visible by the bright rays of the moon, which, entering through the broken ceiling, shed their refulgent beams on feet cased in elegantly made boots of polished leather, over which descended fashionably cut trousers of black cloth.
Perplexity: 240226880.0000

Sentence: 20135m from the imperfect means franz had of judging, he could only come to one conclusion,—that the person whom he was thus watching certainly belonged to no inferior station of life.
Perplexity: 124908160.0000

Sentence: some few minutes had elapsed, and the stranger began to show manifest signs of impatience, when a slight noise was heard outside the aperture in the roof, and almost immediately a dark shadow seemed to obstruct the flood of light that had entered it, and the figure of a man was clearly seen gazing with eager scrutiny on the immense space beneath him; then, as his eye caught sight of him in the mantle, he grasped a floating mass of thickly matted boughs, and glided down by their help to within three or four feet of the ground, and then leaped lightly on his feet.
Perplexity: 506294560.0000

Sentence: the man who had performed this daring act with so much indifference wore the transtevere costume.
Perplexity: 1289440384.0000

Sentence: “i beg your excellency’s pardon for keeping you waiting,” said the man, in the roman dialect, “but i don’t think i’m many minutes after my time, ten o’clock has just struck by the clock of saint john lateran.” “say not a word about being late,” replied the stranger in purest tuscan; “’tis i who am too soon.
Perplexity: 473049440.0000

Sentence: but even if you had caused me to wait a little while, i should have felt quite sure that the delay was not occasioned by any fault of yours.” “your excellency is perfectly right in so thinking,” said the man; “i came here direct from the castle of st. angelo, and i had an immense deal of trouble before i could get a chance to speak to beppo.” “and who is beppo?” “oh, beppo is employed in the prison, and i give him so much a year to let me know what is going on within his holiness’s castle.” “indeed!
Perplexity: 448913312.0000

Sentence: you are a provident person, i see.” “why, you see, no one knows what may happen.
Perplexity: 56479924.0000

Sentence: perhaps some of these days i may be entrapped, like poor peppino and may be very glad to have some little nibbling mouse to gnaw the meshes of my net, and so help me out of prison.” “briefly, what did you learn?” “that two executions of considerable interest will take place the day after tomorrow at two o’clock, as is customary at rome at the commencement of all great festivals.
Perplexity: 408412928.0000

Sentence: one of the culprits will be _mazzolato_;3 he is an atrocious villain, who murdered the priest who brought him up, and deserves not the smallest pity.
Perplexity: 175469360.0000

Sentence: the other sufferer is sentenced to be _decapitato_;4 and he, your excellency, is poor peppino.” “the fact is, that you have inspired not only the pontifical government, but also the neighboring states, with such extreme fear, that they are glad of all opportunity of making an example.” “but peppino did not even belong to my band; he was merely a poor shepherd, whose only crime consisted in furnishing us with provisions.” “which makes him your accomplice to all intents and purposes.
Perplexity: 284824128.0000

Sentence: but mark the distinction with which he is treated; instead of being knocked on the head as you would be if once they caught hold of you, he is simply sentenced to be guillotined, by which means, too, the amusements of the day are diversified, and there is a spectacle to please every spectator.” “without reckoning the wholly unexpected one i am preparing to surprise them with.” “my good friend,” said the man in the cloak, “excuse me for saying that you seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild or extravagant act.” “perhaps i am; but one thing i have resolved on, and that is, to stop at nothing to restore a poor devil to liberty, who has got into this scrape solely from having served me.
Perplexity: 84818752.0000

Sentence: i should hate and despise myself as a coward did i desert the brave fellow in his present extremity.” “and what do you mean to do?” “to surround the scaffold with twenty of my best men, who, at a signal from me, will rush forward directly peppino is brought for execution, and, by the assistance of their stilettos, drive back the guard, and carry off the prisoner.” “that seems to me as hazardous as uncertain, and convinces me that my scheme is far better than yours.” “and what is your excellency’s project?” “just this.
Perplexity: 147764528.0000

Sentence: i will so advantageously bestow 2,000 piastres, that the person receiving them shall obtain a respite till next year for peppino; and during that year, another skilfully placed 1,000 piastres will afford him the means of escaping from his prison.” “and do you feel sure of succeeding?” “_pardieu!_” exclaimed the man in the cloak, suddenly expressing himself in french.
Perplexity: 179852656.0000

Sentence: “what did your excellency say?” inquired the other.
Perplexity: 43860188.0000

Sentence: “i said, my good fellow, that i would do more single-handed by the means of gold than you and all your troop could effect with stilettos, pistols, carbines, and blunderbusses included.
Perplexity: 1090030080.0000

Sentence: leave me, then, to act, and have no fears for the result.” “at least, there can be no harm in myself and party being in readiness, in case your excellency should fail.” “none whatever.
Perplexity: 232032992.0000

Sentence: take what precautions you please, if it is any satisfaction to you to do so; but rely upon my obtaining the reprieve i seek.” “remember, the execution is fixed for the day after tomorrow, and that you have but one day to work in.” “and what of that?
Perplexity: 1031525824.0000

Sentence: is not a day divided into twenty-four hours, each hour into sixty minutes, and every minute sub-divided into sixty seconds?
Perplexity: 328388800.0000

Sentence: now in 86,400 seconds very many things can be done.” “and how shall i know whether your excellency has succeeded or not.” “oh, that is very easily arranged.
Perplexity: 392039392.0000

Sentence: i have engaged the three lower windows at the café rospoli; should i have obtained the requisite pardon for peppino, the two outside windows will be hung with yellow damasks, and the centre with white, having a large cross in red marked on it.” “and whom will you employ to carry the reprieve to the officer directing the execution?” “send one of your men, disguised as a penitent friar, and i will give it to him.
Perplexity: 99055232.0000

Sentence: his dress will procure him the means of approaching the scaffold itself, and he will deliver the official order to the officer, who, in his turn, will hand it to the executioner; in the meantime, it will be as well to acquaint peppino with what we have determined on, if it be only to prevent his dying of fear or losing his senses, because in either case a very useless expense will have been incurred.” “your excellency,” said the man, “you are fully persuaded of my entire devotion to you, are you not?” “nay, i flatter myself that there can be no doubt of it,” replied the cavalier in the cloak.
Perplexity: 2017184896.0000

Sentence: “well, then, only fulfil your promise of rescuing peppino, and henceforward you shall receive not only devotion, but the most absolute obedience from myself and those under me that one human being can render to another.” “have a care how far you pledge yourself, my good friend, for i may remind you of your promise at some, perhaps, not very distant period, when i, in my turn, may require your aid and influence.” “let that day come sooner or later, your excellency will find me what i have found you in this my heavy trouble; and if from the other end of the world you but write me word to do such or such a thing, you may regard it as done, for done it shall be, on the word and faith of——” “hush!” interrupted the stranger; “i hear a noise.” “’tis some travellers, who are visiting the colosseum by torchlight.” “’twere better we should not be seen together; those guides are nothing but spies, and might possibly recognize you; and, however i may be honored by your friendship, my worthy friend, if once the extent of our intimacy were known, i am sadly afraid both my reputation and credit would suffer thereby.” “well, then, if you obtain the reprieve?” “the middle window at the café rospoli will be hung with white damask, bearing a red cross.” “and if you fail?” “then all three windows will have yellow draperies.” “and then?” “and then, my good fellow, use your daggers in any way you please, and i further promise you to be there as a spectator of your prowess.” “we understand each other perfectly, then.
Perplexity: 717440832.0000

Sentence: adieu, your excellency; depend upon me as firmly as i do upon you.” saying these words, the transteverin disappeared down the staircase, while his companion, muffling his features more closely than before in the folds of his mantle, passed almost close to franz, and descended to the arena by an outward flight of steps.
Perplexity: 66228484.0000

Sentence: the next minute franz heard himself called by albert, who made the lofty building re-echo with the sound of his friend’s name.
Perplexity: 149300880.0000

Sentence: franz, however, did not obey the summons till he had satisfied himself that the two men whose conversation he had overheard were at a sufficient distance to prevent his encountering them in his descent.
Perplexity: 510445568.0000

Sentence: in ten minutes after the strangers had departed, franz was on the road to the piazza di spagna, listening with studied indifference to the learned dissertation delivered by albert, after the manner of pliny and calpurnius, touching the iron-pointed nets used to prevent the ferocious beasts from springing on the spectators.
Perplexity: 513554944.0000

Sentence: franz let him proceed without interruption, and, in fact, did not hear what was said; he longed to be alone, and free to ponder over all that had occurred.
Perplexity: 1931419904.0000

Sentence: one of the two men, whose mysterious meeting in the colosseum he had so unintentionally witnessed, was an entire stranger to him, but not so the other; and though franz had been unable to distinguish his features, from his being either wrapped in his mantle or obscured by the shadow, the tones of his voice had made too powerful an impression on him the first time he had heard them for him ever again to forget them, hear them when or where he might.
Perplexity: 316617792.0000

Sentence: it was more especially when this man was speaking in a manner half jesting, half bitter, that franz’s ear recalled most vividly the deep sonorous, yet well-pitched voice that had addressed him in the grotto of monte cristo, and which he heard for the second time amid the darkness and ruined grandeur of the colosseum.
Perplexity: 24639026.0000

Sentence: and the more he thought, the more entire was his conviction, that the person who wore the mantle was no other than his former host and entertainer, “sinbad the sailor.” 20139m under any other circumstances, franz would have found it impossible to resist his extreme curiosity to know more of so singular a personage, and with that intent have sought to renew their short acquaintance; but in the present instance, the confidential nature of the conversation he had overheard made him, with propriety, judge that his appearance at such a time would be anything but agreeable.
Perplexity: 14765649920.0000

Sentence: as we have seen, therefore, he permitted his former host to retire without attempting a recognition, but fully promising himself a rich indemnity for his present forbearance should chance afford him another opportunity.
Perplexity: 114936328.0000

Sentence: in vain did franz endeavor to forget the many perplexing thoughts which assailed him; in vain did he court the refreshment of sleep.
Perplexity: 15887439.0000

Sentence: slumber refused to visit his eyelids and the night was passed in feverish contemplation of the chain of circumstances tending to prove the identity of the mysterious visitant to the colosseum with the inhabitant of the grotto of monte cristo; and the more he thought, the firmer grew his opinion on the subject.
Perplexity: 481704640.0000

Sentence: worn out at length, he fell asleep at daybreak, and did not awake till late.
Perplexity: 251197280.0000

Sentence: like a genuine frenchman, albert had employed his time in arranging for the evening’s diversion; he had sent to engage a box at the teatro argentina; and franz, having a number of letters to write, relinquished the carriage to albert for the whole of the day.
Perplexity: 378086400.0000

Sentence: at five o’clock albert returned, delighted with his day’s work; he had been occupied in leaving his letters of introduction, and had received in return more invitations to balls and routs than it would be possible for him to accept; besides this, he had seen (as he called it) all the remarkable sights at rome.
Perplexity: 171304944.0000

Sentence: yes, in a single day he had accomplished what his more serious-minded companion would have taken weeks to effect.
Perplexity: 395254400.0000

Sentence: neither had he neglected to ascertain the name of the piece to be played that night at the teatro argentina, and also what performers appeared in it.
Perplexity: 169604592.0000

Sentence: the opera of _parisina_ was announced for representation, and the principal actors were coselli, moriani, and la specchia.
Perplexity: 51760920.0000

Sentence: the young men, therefore, had reason to consider themselves fortunate in having the opportunity of hearing one of the best works by the composer of _lucia di lammermoor_, supported by three of the most renowned vocalists of italy.
Perplexity: 44470064.0000

Sentence: albert had never been able to endure the italian theatres, with their orchestras from which it is impossible to see, and the absence of balconies, or open boxes; all these defects pressed hard on a man who had had his stall at the bouffes, and had shared a lower box at the opera.
Perplexity: 1114862464.0000

Sentence: still, in spite of this, albert displayed his most dazzling and effective costumes each time he visited the theatres; but, alas, his elegant toilet was wholly thrown away, and one of the most worthy representatives of parisian fashion had to carry with him the mortifying reflection that he had nearly overrun italy without meeting with a single adventure.
Perplexity: 25978076.0000

Sentence: sometimes albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success; but internally he was deeply wounded, and his self-love immensely piqued, to think that albert de morcerf, the most admired and most sought after of any young person of his day, should thus be passed over, and merely have his labor for his pains.
Perplexity: 807744320.0000

Sentence: and the thing was so much the more annoying, as, according to the characteristic modesty of a frenchman, albert had quitted paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself in italy to carry all before him, and that upon his return he should astonish the parisian world with the recital of his numerous love-affairs.
Perplexity: 589446464.0000

Sentence: alas, poor albert!
Perplexity: 176391808.0000

Sentence: none of those interesting adventures fell in his way; the lovely genoese, florentines, and neapolitans were all faithful, if not to their husbands, at least to their lovers, and thought not of changing even for the splendid appearance of albert de morcerf; and all he gained was the painful conviction that the ladies of italy have this advantage over those of france, that they are faithful even in their infidelity.
Perplexity: 26049326.0000

Sentence: yet he could not restrain a hope that in italy, as elsewhere, there might be an exception to the general rule.
Perplexity: 649254976.0000

Sentence: albert, besides being an elegant, well-looking young man, was also possessed of considerable talent and ability; moreover, he was a viscount—a recently created one, certainly, but in the present day it is not necessary to go as far back as noah in tracing a descent, and a genealogical tree is equally estimated, whether dated from 1399 or merely 1815; but to crown all these advantages, albert de morcerf commanded an income of 50,000 livres, a more than sufficient sum to render him a personage of considerable importance in paris.
Perplexity: 276202144.0000

Sentence: it was therefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the principal cities in italy without having excited the most trifling observation.
Perplexity: 922063040.0000

Sentence: albert, however, hoped to indemnify himself for all these slights and indifferences during the carnival, knowing full well that among the different states and kingdoms in which this festivity is celebrated, rome is the spot where even the wisest and gravest throw off the usual rigidity of their lives, and deign to mingle in the follies of this time of liberty and relaxation.
Perplexity: 4399747584.0000

Sentence: the carnival was to commence on the morrow; therefore albert had not an instant to lose in setting forth the programme of his hopes, expectations, and claims to notice.
Perplexity: 257840368.0000

Sentence: with this design he had engaged a box in the most conspicuous part of the theatre, and exerted himself to set off his personal attractions by the aid of the most rich and elaborate toilet.
Perplexity: 1424237440.0000

Sentence: the box taken by albert was in the first circle; although each of the three tiers of boxes is deemed equally aristocratic, and is, for this reason, generally styled the “nobility’s boxes,” and although the box engaged for the two friends was sufficiently capacious to contain at least a dozen persons, it had cost less than would be paid at some of the french theatres for one admitting merely four occupants.
Perplexity: 183879440.0000

Sentence: another motive had influenced albert’s selection of his seat,—who knew but that, thus advantageously placed, he might not in truth attract the notice of some fair roman, and an introduction might ensue that would procure him the offer of a seat in a carriage, or a place in a princely balcony, from which he might behold the gayeties of the carnival?
Perplexity: 236177040.0000

Sentence: these united considerations made albert more lively and anxious to please than he had hitherto been.
Perplexity: 223972032.0000

Sentence: totally disregarding the business of the stage, he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing the beauty of each pretty woman, aided by a powerful opera-glass; but, alas, this attempt to attract notice wholly failed; not even curiosity had been excited, and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures, into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing, were all so much engrossed with themselves, their lovers, or their own thoughts, that they had not so much as noticed him or the manipulation of his glass.
Perplexity: 93433120.0000

Sentence: the truth was, that the anticipated pleasures of the carnival, with the “holy week” that was to succeed it, so filled every fair breast, as to prevent the least attention being bestowed even on the business of the stage.
Perplexity: 28216312.0000

Sentence: the actors made their entries and exits unobserved or unthought of; at certain conventional moments, the spectators would suddenly cease their conversation, or rouse themselves from their musings, to listen to some brilliant effort of moriani’s, a well-executed recitative by coselli, or to join in loud applause at the wonderful powers of la specchia; but that momentary excitement over, they quickly relapsed into their former state of preoccupation or interesting conversation.
Perplexity: 1455744768.0000

Sentence: towards the close of the first act, the door of a box which had been hitherto vacant was opened; a lady entered to whom franz had been introduced in paris, where indeed, he had imagined she still was.
Perplexity: 48190572.0000

Sentence: the quick eye of albert caught the involuntary start with which his friend beheld the new arrival, and, turning to him, he said hastily: “do you know the woman who has just entered that box?” “yes; what do you think of her?” “oh, she is perfectly lovely—what a complexion!
Perplexity: 893970368.0000

Sentence: and such magnificent hair!
Perplexity: 2834439424.0000

Sentence: is she french?” “no; a venetian.” “and her name is——” “countess g——.” “ah, i know her by name!” exclaimed albert; “she is said to possess as much wit and cleverness as beauty.
Perplexity: 91497952.0000

Sentence: i was to have been presented to her when i met her at madame villefort’s ball.” “shall i assist you in repairing your negligence?” asked franz.
Perplexity: 193498816.0000

Sentence: “my dear fellow, are you really on such good terms with her as to venture to take me to her box?” “why, i have only had the honor of being in her society and conversing with her three or four times in my life; but you know that even such an acquaintance as that might warrant my doing what you ask.” at that instant, the countess perceived franz, and graciously waved her hand to him, to which he replied by a respectful inclination of the head.
Perplexity: 28034830.0000

Sentence: “upon my word,” said albert, “you seem to be on excellent terms with the beautiful countess.” “you are mistaken in thinking so,” returned franz calmly; “but you merely fall into the same error which leads so many of our countrymen to commit the most egregious blunders,—i mean that of judging the habits and customs of italy and spain by our parisian notions; believe me, nothing is more fallacious than to form any estimate of the degree of intimacy you may suppose existing among persons by the familiar terms they seem upon; there is a similarity of feeling at this instant between ourselves and the countess—nothing more.” “is there, indeed, my good fellow?
Perplexity: 435221248.0000

Sentence: pray tell me, is it sympathy of heart?” “no; of taste,” continued franz gravely.
Perplexity: 444296448.0000

Sentence: “and in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced?” “by the countess’s visiting the colosseum, as we did last night, by moonlight, and nearly alone.” “you were with her, then?” “i was.” “and what did you say to her?” “oh, we talked of the illustrious dead of whom that magnificent ruin is a glorious monument!” “upon my word,” cried albert, “you must have been a very entertaining companion alone, or all but alone, with a beautiful woman in such a place of sentiment as the colosseum, and yet to find nothing better to talk about than the dead!
Perplexity: 1306699520.0000

Sentence: all i can say is, if ever i should get such a chance, the living should be my theme.” 20143m “and you will probably find your theme ill-chosen.” “but,” said albert, breaking in upon his discourse, “never mind the past; let us only remember the present.
Perplexity: 75949584.0000

Sentence: are you not going to keep your promise of introducing me to the fair subject of our remarks?” “certainly, directly the curtain falls on the stage.” “what a confounded long time this first act lasts.
Perplexity: 224434288.0000

Sentence: i believe, on my soul, that they never mean to finish it.” “oh, yes, they will; only listen to that charming finale.
Perplexity: 68860160.0000

Sentence: how exquisitely coselli sings his part.” “but what an awkward, inelegant fellow he is.” “well, then, what do you say to la specchia?
Perplexity: 3110096896.0000

Sentence: did you ever see anything more perfect than her acting?” “why, you know, my dear fellow, when one has been accustomed to malibran and sontag, such singers as these don’t make the same impression on you they perhaps do on others.” “at least, you must admire moriani’s style and execution.” “i never fancied men of his dark, ponderous appearance singing with a voice like a woman’s.” “my good friend,” said franz, turning to him, while albert continued to point his glass at every box in the theatre, “you seem determined not to approve; you are really too difficult to please.” the curtain at length fell on the performances, to the infinite satisfaction of the viscount of morcerf, who seized his hat, rapidly passed his fingers through his hair, arranged his cravat and wristbands, and signified to franz that he was waiting for him to lead the way.
Perplexity: 362484512.0000

Sentence: franz, who had mutely interrogated the countess, and received from her a gracious smile in token that he would be welcome, sought not to retard the gratification of albert’s eager impatience, but began at once the tour of the house, closely followed by albert, who availed himself of the few minutes required to reach the opposite side of the theatre to settle the height and smoothness of his collar, and to arrange the lappets of his coat.
Perplexity: 1368103936.0000

Sentence: this important task was just completed as they arrived at the countess’s box.
Perplexity: 365169376.0000

Sentence: at the knock, the door was immediately opened, and the young man who was seated beside the countess, in obedience to the italian custom, instantly rose and surrendered his place to the strangers, who, in turn, would be expected to retire upon the arrival of other visitors.
Perplexity: 61395436.0000

Sentence: franz presented albert as one of the most distinguished young men of the day, both as regarded his position in society and extraordinary talents; nor did he say more than the truth, for in paris and the circle in which the viscount moved, he was looked upon and cited as a model of perfection.
Perplexity: 74289048.0000

Sentence: franz added that his companion, deeply grieved at having been prevented the honor of being presented to the countess during her sojourn in paris, was most anxious to make up for it, and had requested him (franz) to remedy the past misfortune by conducting him to her box, and concluded by asking pardon for his presumption in having taken it upon himself to do so.
Perplexity: 56615388.0000

Sentence: the countess, in reply, bowed gracefully to albert, and extended her hand with cordial kindness to franz; then, inviting albert to take the vacant seat beside her, she recommended franz to take the next best, if he wished to view the ballet, and pointed to the one behind her own chair.
Perplexity: 82995648.0000

Sentence: albert was soon deeply engrossed in discoursing upon paris and parisian matters, speaking to the countess of the various persons they both knew there.
Perplexity: 399728192.0000

Sentence: franz perceived how completely he was in his element; and, unwilling to interfere with the pleasure he so evidently felt, took up albert’s glass, and began in his turn to survey the audience.
Perplexity: 836675328.0000

Sentence: sitting alone, in the front of a box immediately opposite, but situated on the third row, was a woman of exquisite beauty, dressed in a greek costume, which evidently, from the ease and grace with which she wore it, was her national attire.
Perplexity: 28369300.0000

Sentence: behind her, but in deep shadow, was the outline of a masculine figure; but the features of this latter personage it was not possible to distinguish.
Perplexity: 328463968.0000

Sentence: franz could not forbear breaking in upon the apparently interesting conversation passing between the countess and albert, to inquire of the former if she knew who was the fair albanian opposite, since beauty such as hers was well worthy of being observed by either sex.
Perplexity: 274412096.0000

Sentence: “all i can tell about her,” replied the countess, “is, that she has been at rome since the beginning of the season; for i saw her where she now sits the very first night of the season, and since then she has never missed a performance.
Perplexity: 269738592.0000

Sentence: sometimes she is accompanied by the person who is now with her, and at others she is merely attended by a black servant.” “and what do you think of her personal appearance?” “oh, i consider her perfectly lovely—she is just my idea of what medora must have been.” franz and the countess exchanged a smile, and then the latter resumed her conversation with albert, while franz returned to his previous survey of the house and company.
Perplexity: 204401984.0000

Sentence: the curtain rose on the ballet, which was one of those excellent specimens of the italian school, admirably arranged and put on the stage by henri, who has established for himself a great reputation throughout italy for his taste and skill in the choreographic art—one of those masterly productions of grace, method, and elegance in which the whole _corps de ballet_, from the principal dancers to the humblest supernumerary, are all engaged on the stage at the same time; and a hundred and fifty persons may be seen exhibiting the same attitude, or elevating the same arm or leg with a simultaneous movement, that would lead you to suppose that but one mind, one act of volition, influenced the moving mass.
Perplexity: 1021142848.0000

Sentence: the ballet was called _poliska_.
Perplexity: 246309088.0000

Sentence: however much the ballet might have claimed his attention, franz was too deeply occupied with the beautiful greek to take any note of it; while she seemed to experience an almost childlike delight in watching it, her eager, animated looks contrasting strongly with the utter indifference of her companion, who, during the whole time the piece lasted, never even moved, not even when the furious, crashing din produced by the trumpets, cymbals, and chinese bells sounded their loudest from the orchestra.
Perplexity: 183229664.0000

Sentence: of this he took no heed, but was, as far as appearances might be trusted, enjoying soft repose and bright celestial dreams.
Perplexity: 426718656.0000

Sentence: the ballet at length came to a close, and the curtain fell amid the loud, unanimous plaudits of an enthusiastic and delighted audience.
Perplexity: 389343296.0000

Sentence: owing to the very judicious plan of dividing the two acts of the opera with a ballet, the pauses between the performances are very short, the singers in the opera having time to repose themselves and change their costume, when necessary, while the dancers are executing their pirouettes and exhibiting their graceful steps.
Perplexity: 79472056.0000

Sentence: the overture to the second act began; and, at the first sound of the leader’s bow across his violin, franz observed the sleeper slowly arise and approach the greek girl, who turned around to say a few words to him, and then, leaning forward again on the railing of her box, she became as absorbed as before in what was going on.
Perplexity: 30560942.0000

Sentence: the countenance of the person who had addressed her remained so completely in the shade, that, though franz tried his utmost, he could not distinguish a single feature.
Perplexity: 134121448.0000

Sentence: the curtain rose, and the attention of franz was attracted by the actors; and his eyes turned from the box containing the greek girl and her strange companion to watch the business of the stage.
Perplexity: 37338712.0000

Sentence: most of my readers are aware that the second act of _parisina_ opens with the celebrated and effective duet in which parisina, while sleeping, betrays to azzo the secret of her love for ugo.
Perplexity: 2039340032.0000

Sentence: the injured husband goes through all the emotions of jealousy, until conviction seizes on his mind, and then, in a frenzy of rage and indignation, he awakens his guilty wife to tell her that he knows her guilt and to threaten her with his vengeance.
Perplexity: 271101824.0000

Sentence: this duet is one of the most beautiful, expressive and terrible conceptions that has ever emanated from the fruitful pen of donizetti.
Perplexity: 41557448.0000

Sentence: franz now listened to it for the third time; yet its notes, so tenderly expressive and fearfully grand as the wretched husband and wife give vent to their different griefs and passions, thrilled through the soul of franz with an effect equal to his first emotions upon hearing it.
Perplexity: 35498472.0000

Sentence: excited beyond his usual calm demeanor, franz rose with the audience, and was about to join the loud, enthusiastic applause that followed; but suddenly his purpose was arrested, his hands fell by his sides, and the half-uttered “bravos” expired on his lips.
Perplexity: 90136984.0000

Sentence: the occupant of the box in which the greek girl sat appeared to share the universal admiration that prevailed; for he left his seat to stand up in front, so that, his countenance being fully revealed, franz had no difficulty in recognizing him as the mysterious inhabitant of monte cristo, and the very same person he had encountered the preceding evening in the ruins of the colosseum, and whose voice and figure had seemed so familiar to him.
Perplexity: 411766912.0000

Sentence: all doubt of his identity was now at an end; his singular host evidently resided at rome.
Perplexity: 34759520.0000

Sentence: the surprise and agitation occasioned by this full confirmation of franz’s former suspicion had no doubt imparted a corresponding expression to his features; for the countess, after gazing with a puzzled look at his face, burst into a fit of laughter, and begged to know what had happened.
Perplexity: 1443845888.0000

Sentence: “countess,” returned franz, totally unheeding her raillery, “i asked you a short time since if you knew any particulars respecting the albanian lady opposite; i must now beseech you to inform me who and what is her husband?” “nay,” answered the countess, “i know no more of him than yourself.” “perhaps you never before noticed him?” “what a question—so truly french!
Perplexity: 74094896.0000

Sentence: do you not know that we italians have eyes only for the man we love?” “true,” replied franz.
Perplexity: 426632384.0000

Sentence: “all i can say is,” continued the countess, taking up the _lorgnette_, and directing it toward the box in question, “that the gentleman, whose history i am unable to furnish, seems to me as though he had just been dug up; he looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly grave-digger to quit his tomb for a while, and revisit this earth of ours, than anything human.
Perplexity: 194764784.0000

Sentence: how ghastly pale he is!” “oh, he is always as colorless as you now see him,” said franz.
Perplexity: 83946432.0000

Sentence: “then you know him?” almost screamed the countess.
Perplexity: 328851360.0000

Sentence: “oh, pray do, for heaven’s sake, tell us all about—is he a vampire, or a resuscitated corpse, or what?” “i fancy i have seen him before; and i even think he recognizes me.” “and i can well understand,” said the countess, shrugging up her beautiful shoulders, as though an involuntary shudder passed through her veins, “that those who have once seen that man will never be likely to forget him.” the sensation experienced by franz was evidently not peculiar to himself; another, and wholly uninterested person, felt the same unaccountable awe and misgiving.
Perplexity: 233506528.0000

Sentence: “well.” inquired franz, after the countess had a second time directed her _lorgnette_ at the box, “what do you think of our opposite neighbor?” 20147m “why, that he is no other than lord ruthven himself in a living form.” this fresh allusion to byron5 drew a smile to franz’s countenance; although he could but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires, it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before him.
Perplexity: 1069799616.0000

Sentence: “i must positively find out who and what he is,” said franz, rising from his seat.
Perplexity: 182941552.0000

Sentence: “no, no,” cried the countess; “you must not leave me.
Perplexity: 473526080.0000

Sentence: i depend upon you to escort me home.
Perplexity: 316751904.0000

Sentence: oh, indeed, i cannot permit you to go.” “is it possible,” whispered franz, “that you entertain any fear?” “i’ll tell you,” answered the countess.
Perplexity: 173839392.0000

Sentence: “byron had the most perfect belief in the existence of vampires, and even assured me that he had seen them.
Perplexity: 3492729856.0000

Sentence: the description he gave me perfectly corresponds with the features and character of the man before us.
Perplexity: 1864666112.0000

Sentence: oh, he is the exact personification of what i have been led to expect!
Perplexity: 3118662400.0000

Perplexity: 249483600.0000

Perplexity: 1363339648.0000

Sentence: now, i cannot for one instant believe you so devoid of gallantry as to refuse a lady your escort when she even condescends to ask you for it.” there was nothing else left for franz to do but to take up his hat, open the door of the box, and offer the countess his arm.
Perplexity: 170521248.0000

Sentence: it was quite evident, by her manner, that her uneasiness was not feigned; and franz himself could not resist a feeling of superstitious dread—so much the stronger in him, as it arose from a variety of corroborative recollections, while the terror of the countess sprang from an instinctive belief, originally created in her mind by the wild tales she had listened to till she believed them truths.
Perplexity: 39403704.0000

Sentence: franz could even feel her arm tremble as he assisted her into the carriage.
Perplexity: 456432544.0000

Sentence: upon arriving at her hotel, franz perceived that she had deceived him when she spoke of expecting company; on the contrary, her own return before the appointed hour seemed greatly to astonish the servants.
Perplexity: 152007328.0000

Sentence: “excuse my little subterfuge,” said the countess, in reply to her companion’s half-reproachful observation on the subject; “but that horrid man had made me feel quite uncomfortable, and i longed to be alone, that i might compose my startled mind.” franz essayed to smile.
Perplexity: 256187856.0000

Sentence: “nay,” said she, “do not smile; it ill accords with the expression of your countenance, and i am sure it does not spring from your heart.
Perplexity: 654645504.0000

Sentence: however, promise me one thing.” “what is it?” “promise me, i say.” “i will do anything you desire, except relinquish my determination of finding out who this man is.
Perplexity: 75791704.0000

Sentence: i have more reasons than you can imagine for desiring to know who he is, from whence he came, and whither he is going.” “where he comes from i am ignorant; but i can readily tell you where he is going to, and that is down below, without the least doubt.” “let us only speak of the promise you wished me to make,” said franz.
Perplexity: 1343727104.0000

Perplexity: 759926592.0000

Sentence: there are certain affinities between the persons we quit and those we meet afterwards.
Perplexity: 90733984.0000

Perplexity: 46550300.0000

Perplexity: 124705816.0000

Sentence: for my own part, i am quite sure i shall not be able to close my eyes.” so saying, the countess quitted franz, leaving him unable to decide whether she were merely amusing herself at his expense, or whether her fears and agitations were genuine.
Perplexity: 141360608.0000

Sentence: upon his return to the hotel, franz found albert in his dressing-gown and slippers, listlessly extended on a sofa, smoking a cigar.
Perplexity: 78225784.0000

Sentence: “my dear fellow!” cried he, springing up, “is it really you?
Perplexity: 467419648.0000

Sentence: why, i did not expect to see you before tomorrow.” “my dear albert,” replied franz, “i am glad of this opportunity to tell you, once and forever, that you entertain a most erroneous notion concerning italian women.
Perplexity: 423510976.0000

Sentence: i should have thought the continual failures you have met with in all your own love affairs might have taught you better by this time.” “upon my soul, these women would puzzle the very devil to read them aright.
Perplexity: 117902792.0000

Sentence: why, here—they give you their hand—they press yours in return—they keep up a whispering conversation—permit you to accompany them home.
Perplexity: 105490816.0000

Sentence: why, if a parisian were to indulge in a quarter of these marks of flattering attention, her reputation would be gone forever.” “and the very reason why the women of this fine country, ‘where sounds the _si_,’ as dante writes, put so little restraint on their words and actions, is because they live so much in public, and have really nothing to conceal.
Perplexity: 862544640.0000

Sentence: besides, you must have perceived that the countess was really alarmed.” “at what?
Perplexity: 866244352.0000

Sentence: at the sight of that respectable gentleman sitting opposite to us in the same box with the lovely greek girl?
Perplexity: 121465280.0000

Sentence: now, for my part, i met them in the lobby after the conclusion of the piece; and hang me, if i can guess where you took your notions of the other world from.
Perplexity: 143045200.0000

Sentence: i can assure you that this hobgoblin of yours is a deuced fine-looking fellow—admirably dressed.
Perplexity: 1306380544.0000

Sentence: indeed, i feel quite sure, from the cut of his clothes, they are made by a first-rate paris tailor—probably blin or humann.
Perplexity: 269189152.0000

Sentence: he was rather too pale, certainly; but then, you know, paleness is always looked upon as a strong proof of aristocratic descent and distinguished breeding.” franz smiled; for he well remembered that albert particularly prided himself on the entire absence of color in his own complexion.
Perplexity: 21252002.0000

Sentence: “well, that tends to confirm my own ideas,” said franz, “that the countess’s suspicions were destitute alike of sense and reason.
Perplexity: 596539200.0000

Sentence: did he speak in your hearing?
Perplexity: 73631392.0000

Sentence: and did you catch any of his words?” “i did; but they were uttered in the romaic dialect.
Perplexity: 104696240.0000

Sentence: i knew that from the mixture of greek words.
Perplexity: 289747936.0000

Sentence: i don’t know whether i ever told you that when i was at college i was rather—rather strong in greek.” “he spoke the romaic language, did he?” “i think so.” “that settles it,” murmured franz.
Perplexity: 24810022.0000

Sentence: “’tis he, past all doubt.” “what do you say?” “nothing, nothing.
Perplexity: 148263376.0000

Sentence: but tell me, what were you thinking about when i came in?” “oh, i was arranging a little surprise for you.” “indeed.
Perplexity: 210919360.0000

Sentence: of what nature?” “why, you know it is quite impossible to procure a carriage.” “certainly; and i also know that we have done all that human means afforded to endeavor to get one.” “now, then, in this difficulty a bright idea has flashed across my brain.” franz looked at albert as though he had not much confidence in the suggestions of his imagination.
Perplexity: 95537424.0000

Sentence: “i tell you what, m. franz,” cried albert, “you deserve to be called out for such a misgiving and incredulous glance as that you were pleased to bestow on me just now.” “and i promise to give you the satisfaction of a gentleman if your scheme turns out as ingenious as you assert.” “well, then, hearken to me.” “i listen.” “you agree, do you not, that obtaining a carriage is out of the question?” “i do.” “neither can we procure horses?” “true; we have offered any sum, but have failed.” “well, now, what do you say to a cart?
Perplexity: 721350080.0000

Sentence: i dare say such a thing might be had.” “very possibly.” “and a pair of oxen?” “as easily found as the cart.” “then you see, my good fellow, with a cart and a couple of oxen our business can be managed.
Perplexity: 23659352.0000

Sentence: the cart must be tastefully ornamented; and if you and i dress ourselves as neapolitan reapers, we may get up a striking tableau, after the manner of that splendid picture by léopold robert.
Perplexity: 79306096.0000

Sentence: it would add greatly to the effect if the countess would join us in the costume of a peasant from puzzoli or sorrento.
Perplexity: 133166576.0000

Sentence: our group would then be quite complete, more especially as the countess is quite beautiful enough to represent a madonna.” “well,” said franz, “this time, m. albert, i am bound to give you credit for having hit upon a most capital idea.” “and quite a national one, too,” replied albert with gratified pride.
Perplexity: 39177828.0000

Sentence: “a mere masque borrowed from our own festivities.
Perplexity: 602771456.0000

Sentence: ha, ha, ye romans!
Perplexity: 361654400.0000

Sentence: you thought to make us, unhappy strangers, trot at the heels of your processions, like so many lazzaroni, because no carriages or horses are to be had in your beggarly city.
Perplexity: 25131264.0000

Sentence: but you don’t know us; when we can’t have one thing we invent another.” “and have you communicated your triumphant idea to anybody?” “only to our host.
Perplexity: 52613052.0000

Sentence: upon my return home i sent for him, and i then explained to him what i wished to procure.
Perplexity: 4903977984.0000

Sentence: he assured me that nothing would be easier than to furnish all i desired.
Perplexity: 237109104.0000

Sentence: one thing i was sorry for; when i bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded, he told me there would not be time, as it would require three days to do that; so you see we must do without this little superfluity.” “and where is he now?” “who?” “our host.” “gone out in search of our equipage, by tomorrow it might be too late.” “then he will be able to give us an answer tonight.” “oh, i expect him every minute.” at this instant the door opened, and the head of signor pastrini appeared.
Perplexity: 69910008.0000

Sentence: “_permesso_?” inquired he.
Perplexity: 230544128.0000

Sentence: “certainly—certainly,” cried franz.
Perplexity: 2129003648.0000

Sentence: “come in, my host.” “now, then,” asked albert eagerly, “have you found the desired cart and oxen?” “better than that!” replied signor pastrini, with the air of a man perfectly well satisfied with himself.
Perplexity: 161172448.0000

Sentence: “take care, my worthy host,” said albert, “_better_ is a sure enemy to _well_.” “let your excellencies only leave the matter to me,” returned signor pastrini in a tone indicative of unbounded self-confidence.
Perplexity: 2823060736.0000

Sentence: “but what _have_ you done?” asked franz.
Perplexity: 259075280.0000

Sentence: “speak out, there’s a worthy fellow.” “your excellencies are aware,” responded the landlord, swelling with importance, “that the count of monte cristo is living on the same floor with yourselves!” “i should think we did know it,” exclaimed albert, “since it is owing to that circumstance that we are packed into these small rooms, like two poor students in the back streets of paris.” “when, then, the count of monte cristo, hearing of the dilemma in which you are placed, has sent to offer you seats in his carriage and two places at his windows in the palazzo rospoli.” the friends looked at each other with unutterable surprise.
Perplexity: 143503760.0000

Sentence: “but do you think,” asked albert, “that we ought to accept such offers from a perfect stranger?” “what sort of person is this count of monte cristo?” asked franz of his host.
Perplexity: 270716864.0000

Sentence: “a very great nobleman, but whether maltese or sicilian i cannot exactly say; but this i know, that he is noble as a borghese and rich as a gold mine.” “it seems to me,” said franz, speaking in an undertone to albert, “that if this person merited the high panegyrics of our landlord, he would have conveyed his invitation through another channel, and not permitted it to be brought to us in this unceremonious way.
Perplexity: 67571576.0000

Sentence: he would have written—or——” at this instant someone knocked at the door.
Perplexity: 950456448.0000

Sentence: “come in,” said franz.
Perplexity: 95878056.0000

Sentence: a servant, wearing a livery of considerable style and richness, appeared at the threshold, and, placing two cards in the landlord’s hands, who forthwith presented them to the two young men, he said: “please to deliver these, from the count of monte cristo to vicomte albert de morcerf and m. franz d’épinay.
Perplexity: 49540536.0000

Sentence: the count of monte cristo,” continued the servant, “begs these gentlemen’s permission to wait upon them as their neighbor, and he will be honored by an intimation of what time they will please to receive him.” “faith, franz,” whispered albert, “there is not much to find fault with here.” “tell the count,” replied franz, “that we will do ourselves the pleasure of calling on him.” the servant bowed and retired.
Perplexity: 71745416.0000

Sentence: “that is what i call an elegant mode of attack,” said albert, “you were quite correct in what you said, signor pastrini.
Perplexity: 128537592.0000

Sentence: the count of monte cristo is unquestionably a man of first-rate breeding and knowledge of the world.” “then you accept his offer?” said the host.
Perplexity: 1673380224.0000

Sentence: “of course we do,” replied albert.
Perplexity: 245879120.0000

Sentence: “still, i must own i am sorry to be obliged to give up the cart and the group of reapers—it would have produced such an effect!
Perplexity: 23988840.0000

Sentence: and were it not for the windows at the palazzo rospoli, by way of recompense for the loss of our beautiful scheme, i don’t know but what i should have held on by my original plan.
Perplexity: 528415712.0000

Sentence: what say you, franz?” “oh, i agree with you; the windows in the palazzo rospoli alone decided me.” the truth was, that the mention of two places in the palazzo rospoli had recalled to franz the conversation he had overheard the preceding evening in the ruins of the colosseum between the mysterious unknown and the transteverin, in which the stranger in the cloak had undertaken to obtain the freedom of a condemned criminal; and if this muffled-up individual proved (as franz felt sure he would) the same as the person he had just seen in the teatro argentina, then he should be able to establish his identity, and also to prosecute his researches respecting him with perfect facility and freedom.
Perplexity: 52078008.0000

Sentence: franz passed the night in confused dreams respecting the two meetings he had already had with his mysterious tormentor, and in waking speculations as to what the morrow would produce.
Perplexity: 1055639296.0000

Sentence: the next day must clear up every doubt; and unless his near neighbor and would-be friend, the count of monte cristo, possessed the ring of gyges, and by its power was able to render himself invisible, it was very certain he could not escape this time.
Perplexity: 1647066112.0000

Sentence: eight o’clock found franz up and dressed, while albert, who had not the same motives for early rising, was still soundly asleep.
Perplexity: 25784124.0000

Sentence: the first act of franz was to summon his landlord, who presented himself with his accustomed obsequiousness.
Perplexity: 4559220224.0000

Sentence: “pray, signor pastrini,” asked franz, “is not some execution appointed to take place today?” “yes, your excellency; but if your reason for inquiry is that you may procure a window to view it from, you are much too late.” “oh, no,” answered franz, “i had no such intention; and even if i had felt a wish to witness the spectacle, i might have done so from monte pincio; could i not?” “ah!” exclaimed mine host, “i did not think it likely your excellency would have chosen to mingle with such a rabble as are always collected on that hill, which, indeed, they consider as exclusively belonging to themselves.” “very possibly i may not go,” answered franz; “but in case i feel disposed, give me some particulars of today’s executions.” “what particulars would your excellency like to hear?” “why, the number of persons condemned to suffer, their names, and description of the death they are to die.” “that happens just lucky, your excellency!
Perplexity: 145748320.0000

Sentence: only a few minutes ago they brought me the _tavolettas_.” “what are they?” “sort of wooden tablets hung up at the corners of streets the evening before an execution, on which is pasted up a paper containing the names of the condemned persons, their crimes, and mode of punishment.
Perplexity: 21779850.0000

Sentence: the reason for so publicly announcing all this is, that all good and faithful catholics may offer up their prayers for the unfortunate culprits, and, above all, beseech of heaven to grant them a sincere repentance.” “and these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to those of the faithful, are they?” asked franz somewhat incredulously.
Perplexity: 393446944.0000

Sentence: “oh, dear, no, your excellency!
Perplexity: 237254752.0000

Sentence: i have not time for anybody’s affairs but my own and those of my honorable guests; but i make an agreement with the man who pastes up the papers, and he brings them to me as he would the playbills, that in case any person staying at my hotel should like to witness an execution, he may obtain every requisite information concerning the time and place etc.” “upon my word, that is a most delicate attention on your part, signor pastrini,” cried franz.
Perplexity: 153696224.0000

Sentence: “why, your excellency,” returned the landlord, chuckling and rubbing his hands with infinite complacency, “i think i may take upon myself to say i neglect nothing to deserve the support and patronage of the noble visitors to this poor hotel.” “i see that plainly enough, my most excellent host, and you may rely upon me to proclaim so striking a proof of your attention to your guests wherever i go.
Perplexity: 34243672.0000

Sentence: meanwhile, oblige me by a sight of one of these _tavolettas_.” “nothing can be easier than to comply with your excellency’s wish,” said the landlord, opening the door of the chamber; “i have caused one to be placed on the landing, close by your apartment.” then, taking the tablet from the wall, he handed it to franz, who read as follows: “‘the public is informed that on wednesday, february 23rd, being the first day of the carnival, executions will take place in the piazza del popolo, by order of the tribunal of the rota, of two persons, named andrea rondolo, and peppino, otherwise called rocca priori; the former found guilty of the murder of a venerable and exemplary priest, named don césar torlini, canon of the church of st. john lateran; and the latter convicted of being an accomplice of the atrocious and sanguinary bandit, luigi vampa, and his band.
Perplexity: 857505472.0000

Sentence: the first-named malefactor will be _mazzolato_, the second culprit _decapitato_.
Perplexity: 134588368.0000

Sentence: “‘the prayers of all good christians are entreated for these unfortunate men, that it may please god to awaken them to a sense of their guilt, and to grant them a hearty and sincere repentance for their crimes.’” this was precisely what franz had heard the evening before in the ruins of the colosseum.
Perplexity: 124385360.0000

Sentence: no part of the programme differed,—the names of the condemned persons, their crimes, and mode of punishment, all agreed with his previous information.
Perplexity: 2750488832.0000

Sentence: in all probability, therefore, the transteverin was no other than the bandit luigi vampa himself, and the man shrouded in the mantle the same he had known as “sinbad the sailor,” but who, no doubt, was still pursuing his philanthropic expedition in rome, as he had already done at porto-vecchio and tunis.
Perplexity: 27285144.0000

Sentence: time was getting on, however, and franz deemed it advisable to awaken albert; but at the moment he prepared to proceed to his chamber, his friend entered the room in perfect costume for the day.
Perplexity: 46072424.0000

Sentence: the anticipated delights of the carnival had so run in his head as to make him leave his pillow long before his usual hour.
Perplexity: 954458624.0000

Sentence: “now, my excellent signor pastrini,” said franz, addressing his landlord, “since we are both ready, do you think we may proceed at once to visit the count of monte cristo?” “most assuredly,” replied he.
Perplexity: 167001856.0000

Sentence: “the count of monte cristo is always an early riser; and i can answer for his having been up these two hours.” “then you really consider we shall not be intruding if we pay our respects to him directly?” 20155m “oh, i am quite sure.
Perplexity: 727251712.0000

Sentence: i will take all the blame on myself if you find i have led you into an error.” “well, then, if it be so, are you ready, albert?” “perfectly.” “let us go and return our best thanks for his courtesy.” “yes, let us do so.” the landlord preceded the friends across the landing, which was all that separated them from the apartments of the count, rang at the bell, and, upon the door being opened by a servant, said: “_i signori francesi_.” the domestic bowed respectfully, and invited them to enter.
Perplexity: 34725128.0000

Sentence: they passed through two rooms, furnished in a luxurious manner they had not expected to see under the roof of signor pastrini, and were shown into an elegantly fitted-up drawing-room.
Perplexity: 1868154752.0000

Sentence: the richest turkey carpets covered the floor, and the softest and most inviting couches, easy-chairs, and sofas, offered their high-piled and yielding cushions to such as desired repose or refreshment.
Perplexity: 106454144.0000

Sentence: splendid paintings by the first masters were ranged against the walls, intermingled with magnificent trophies of war, while heavy curtains of costly tapestry were suspended before the different doors of the room.
Perplexity: 737023936.0000

Perplexity: 168629792.0000

Sentence: as the door opened, the sound of a _guzla_ reached the ears of the young men, but was almost immediately lost, for the rapid closing of the door merely allowed one rich swell of harmony to enter.
Perplexity: 134184400.0000

Sentence: franz and albert looked inquiringly at each other, then at the gorgeous furnishings of the apartment.
Perplexity: 138644432.0000

Sentence: everything seemed more magnificent at a second view than it had done at their first rapid survey.
Perplexity: 1164235008.0000

Sentence: “well,” said franz to his friend, “what think you of all this?” “why, upon my soul, my dear fellow, it strikes me that our elegant and attentive neighbor must either be some successful stock-jobber who has speculated in the fall of the spanish funds, or some prince travelling _incog_.” “hush, hush!” replied franz; “we shall ascertain who and what he is—he comes!” as franz spoke, he heard the sound of a door turning on its hinges, and almost immediately afterwards the tapestry was drawn aside, and the owner of all these riches stood before the two young men.
Perplexity: 809348160.0000

Sentence: albert instantly rose to meet him, but franz remained, in a manner, spellbound on his chair; for in the person of him who had just entered he recognized not only the mysterious visitant to the colosseum, and the occupant of the box at the teatro argentina, but also his extraordinary host of monte cristo.
Perplexity: 34300808.0000

Sentence: la mazzolata gentlemen,” said the count of monte cristo as he entered, “i pray you excuse me for suffering my visit to be anticipated; but i feared to disturb you by presenting myself earlier at your apartments; besides, you sent me word that you would come to me, and i have held myself at your disposal.” “franz and i have to thank you a thousand times, count,” returned albert; “you extricated us from a great dilemma, and we were on the point of inventing a very fantastic vehicle when your friendly invitation reached us.” “indeed,” returned the count, motioning the two young men to sit down.
Perplexity: 637780224.0000

Sentence: “it was the fault of that blockhead pastrini, that i did not sooner assist you in your distress.
Perplexity: 783880256.0000

Sentence: he did not mention a syllable of your embarrassment to me, when he knows that, alone and isolated as i am, i seek every opportunity of making the acquaintance of my neighbors.
Perplexity: 47383392.0000

Sentence: as soon as i learned i could in any way assist you, i most eagerly seized the opportunity of offering my services.” the two young men bowed.
Perplexity: 156465360.0000

Sentence: franz had, as yet, found nothing to say; he had come to no determination, and as nothing in the count’s manner manifested the wish that he should recognize him, he did not know whether to make any allusion to the past, or wait until he had more proof; besides, although sure it was he who had been in the box the previous evening, he could not be equally positive that this was the man he had seen at the colosseum.
Perplexity: 105166560.0000

Sentence: he resolved, therefore, to let things take their course without making any direct overture to the count.
Perplexity: 97200488.0000

Perplexity: 769323008.0000

Sentence: can you tell us where we can obtain a sight of the piazza del popolo?” “ah,” said the count negligently, looking attentively at morcerf, “is there not something like an execution upon the piazza del popolo?” “yes,” returned franz, finding that the count was coming to the point he wished.
Perplexity: 206119520.0000

Sentence: “stay, i think i told my steward yesterday to attend to this; perhaps i can render you this slight service also.” he extended his hand, and rang the bell thrice.
Perplexity: 100283672.0000

Sentence: “did you ever occupy yourself,” said he to franz, “with the employment of time and the means of simplifying the summoning your servants?
Perplexity: 25727286.0000

Sentence: i have.
Perplexity: 532293056.0000

Sentence: when i ring once, it is for my valet; twice, for my majordomo; thrice, for my steward,—thus i do not waste a minute or a word.
Perplexity: 332057632.0000

Perplexity: 140596944.0000

Sentence: it was evident he had his orders.
Perplexity: 87007224.0000

Sentence: “monsieur bertuccio,” said the count, “you have procured me windows looking on the piazza del popolo, as i ordered you yesterday.” “yes, excellency,” returned the steward; “but it was very late.” “did i not tell you i wished for one?” replied the count, frowning.
Perplexity: 46984444.0000

Sentence: “and your excellency has one, which was let to prince lobanieff; but i was obliged to pay a hundred——” “that will do—that will do, monsieur bertuccio; spare these gentlemen all such domestic arrangements.
Perplexity: 804297536.0000

Sentence: you have the window, that is sufficient.
Perplexity: 255194928.0000

Sentence: give orders to the coachman; and be in readiness on the stairs to conduct us to it.” the steward bowed, and was about to quit the room.
Perplexity: 681763072.0000

Sentence: “ah!” continued the count, “be good enough to ask pastrini if he has received the _tavoletta_, and if he can send us an account of the execution.” “there is no need to do that,” said franz, taking out his tablets; “for i saw the account, and copied it down.” “very well, you can retire, m. bertuccio; i need you no longer.
Perplexity: 137512240.0000

Sentence: let us know when breakfast is ready.
Perplexity: 52802252.0000

Sentence: these gentlemen,” added he, turning to the two friends, “will, i trust, do me the honor to breakfast with me?” “but, my dear count,” said albert, “we shall abuse your kindness.” “not at all; on the contrary, you will give me great pleasure.
Perplexity: 826877312.0000

Sentence: you will, one or other of you, perhaps both, return it to me at paris.
Perplexity: 1248929664.0000

Sentence: m. bertuccio, lay covers for three.” he then took franz’s tablets out of his hand.
Perplexity: 236952224.0000

Sentence: “‘we announce,’ he read, in the same tone with which he would have read a newspaper, ‘that today, the 23rd of february, will be executed andrea rondolo, guilty of murder on the person of the respected and venerated don césar torlini, canon of the church of st. john lateran, and peppino, called rocca priori, convicted of complicity with the detestable bandit luigi vampa, and the men of his band.’ “hum!
Perplexity: 114837936.0000

Sentence: ‘the first will be _mazzolato_, the second _decapitato_.’ yes,” continued the count, “it was at first arranged in this way; but i think since yesterday some change has taken place in the order of the ceremony.” “really?” said franz.
Perplexity: 79922160.0000

Sentence: “yes, i passed the evening at the cardinal rospigliosi’s, and there mention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two men.” “for andrea rondolo?” asked franz.
Perplexity: 94376488.0000

Sentence: “no,” replied the count, carelessly; “for the other (he glanced at the tablets as if to recall the name), for peppino, called rocca priori.
Perplexity: 644387968.0000

Sentence: you are thus deprived of seeing a man guillotined; but the _mazzolata_ still remains, which is a very curious punishment when seen for the first time, and even the second, while the other, as you must know, is very simple.
Perplexity: 156349920.0000

Sentence: the _mandaïa_6 never fails, never trembles, never strikes thirty times ineffectually, like the soldier who beheaded the count of chalais, and to whose tender mercy richelieu had doubtless recommended the sufferer.
Perplexity: 58017932.0000

Sentence: ah,” added the count, in a contemptuous tone, “do not tell me of european punishments, they are in the infancy, or rather the old age, of cruelty.” “really, count,” replied franz, “one would think that you had studied the different tortures of all the nations of the world.” “there are, at least, few that i have not seen,” said the count coldly.
Perplexity: 730956416.0000

Sentence: “and you took pleasure in beholding these dreadful spectacles?” “my first sentiment was horror, the second indifference, the third curiosity.” “curiosity—that is a terrible word.” “why so?
Perplexity: 153004784.0000

Sentence: in life, our greatest preoccupation is death; is it not then, curious to study the different ways by which the soul and body can part; and how, according to their different characters, temperaments, and even the different customs of their countries, different persons bear the transition from life to death, from existence to annihilation?
Perplexity: 929144320.0000

Sentence: as for myself, i can assure you of one thing,—the more men you see die, the easier it becomes to die yourself; and in my opinion, death may be a torture, but it is not an expiation.” “i do not quite understand you,” replied franz; “pray explain your meaning, for you excite my curiosity to the highest pitch.” “listen,” said the count, and deep hatred mounted to his face, as the blood would to the face of any other.
Perplexity: 1718918656.0000

Sentence: “if a man had by unheard-of and excruciating tortures destroyed your father, your mother, your betrothed,—a being who, when torn from you, left a desolation, a wound that never closes, in your breast,—do you think the reparation that society gives you is sufficient when it interposes the knife of the guillotine between the base of the occiput and the trapezal muscles of the murderer, and allows him who has caused us years of moral sufferings to escape with a few moments of physical pain?” “yes, i know,” said franz, “that human justice is insufficient to console us; she can give blood in return for blood, that is all; but you must demand from her only what it is in her power to grant.” “i will put another case to you,” continued the count; “that where society, attacked by the death of a person, avenges death by death.
Perplexity: 400434048.0000

Sentence: but are there not a thousand tortures by which a man may be made to suffer without society taking the least cognizance of them, or offering him even the insufficient means of vengeance, of which we have just spoken?
Perplexity: 1090733056.0000

Sentence: are there not crimes for which the impalement of the turks, the augers of the persians, the stake and the brand of the iroquois indians, are inadequate tortures, and which are unpunished by society?
Perplexity: 234471440.0000

Sentence: answer me, do not these crimes exist?” “yes,” answered franz; “and it is to punish them that duelling is tolerated.” “ah, duelling,” cried the count; “a pleasant manner, upon my soul, of arriving at your end when that end is vengeance!
Perplexity: 152980848.0000

Sentence: a man has carried off your mistress, a man has seduced your wife, a man has dishonored your daughter; he has rendered the whole life of one who had the right to expect from heaven that portion of happiness god has promised to everyone of his creatures, an existence of misery and infamy; and you think you are avenged because you send a ball through the head, or pass a sword through the breast, of that man who has planted madness in your brain, and despair in your heart.
Perplexity: 91904960.0000

Sentence: and remember, moreover, that it is often he who comes off victorious from the strife, absolved of all crime in the eyes of the world.
Perplexity: 75244208.0000

Sentence: no, no,” continued the count, “had i to avenge myself, it is not thus i would take revenge.” “then you disapprove of duelling?
Perplexity: 843425728.0000

Sentence: you would not fight a duel?” asked albert in his turn, astonished at this strange theory.
Perplexity: 226505840.0000

Sentence: “oh, yes,” replied the count; “understand me, i would fight a duel for a trifle, for an insult, for a blow; and the more so that, thanks to my skill in all bodily exercises, and the indifference to danger i have gradually acquired, i should be almost certain to kill my man.
Perplexity: 32357998.0000

Sentence: oh, i would fight for such a cause; but in return for a slow, profound, eternal torture, i would give back the same, were it possible; an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, as the orientalists say,—our masters in everything,—those favored creatures who have formed for themselves a life of dreams and a paradise of realities.” “but,” said franz to the count, “with this theory, which renders you at once judge and executioner of your own cause, it would be difficult to adopt a course that would forever prevent your falling under the power of the law.
Perplexity: 294887872.0000

Sentence: hatred is blind, rage carries you away; and he who pours out vengeance runs the risk of tasting a bitter draught.” “yes, if he be poor and inexperienced, not if he be rich and skilful; besides, the worst that could happen to him would be the punishment of which we have already spoken, and which the philanthropic french revolution has substituted for being torn to pieces by horses or broken on the wheel.
Perplexity: 265024368.0000

Sentence: what matters this punishment, as long as he is avenged?
Perplexity: 389940832.0000

Sentence: on my word, i almost regret that in all probability this miserable peppino will not be beheaded, as you might have had an opportunity then of seeing how short a time the punishment lasts, and whether it is worth even mentioning; but, really this is a most singular conversation for the carnival, gentlemen; how did it arise?
Perplexity: 327814912.0000

Sentence: ah, i recollect, you asked for a place at my window; you shall have it; but let us first sit down to table, for here comes the servant to inform us that breakfast is ready.” as he spoke, a servant opened one of the four doors of the apartment, saying: “_al suo commodo!_” the two young men arose and entered the breakfast-room.
Perplexity: 64183012.0000

Sentence: during the meal, which was excellent, and admirably served, franz looked repeatedly at albert, in order to observe the impressions which he doubted not had been made on him by the words of their entertainer; but whether with his usual carelessness he had paid but little attention to him, whether the explanation of the count of monte cristo with regard to duelling had satisfied him, or whether the events which franz knew of had had their effect on him alone, he remarked that his companion did not pay the least regard to them, but on the contrary ate like a man who for the last four or five months had been condemned to partake of italian cookery—that is, the worst in the world.
Perplexity: 47677392.0000

Sentence: as for the count, he just touched the dishes; he seemed to fulfil the duties of a host by sitting down with his guests, and awaited their departure to be served with some strange or more delicate food.
Perplexity: 928070912.0000

Sentence: this brought back to franz, in spite of himself, the recollection of the terror with which the count had inspired the countess g——, and her firm conviction that the man in the opposite box was a vampire.
Perplexity: 534477312.0000

Sentence: at the end of the breakfast franz took out his watch.
Perplexity: 19680246.0000

Sentence: “well,” said the count, “what are you doing?” “you must excuse us, count,” returned franz, “but we have still much to do.” “what may that be?” “we have no masks, and it is absolutely necessary to procure them.” “do not concern yourself about that; we have, i think, a private room in the piazza del popolo; i will have whatever costumes you choose brought to us, and you can dress there.” “after the execution?” cried franz.
Perplexity: 260763312.0000

Sentence: “before or after, whichever you please.” “opposite the scaffold?” “the scaffold forms part of the _fête_.” “count, i have reflected on the matter,” said franz, “i thank you for your courtesy, but i shall content myself with accepting a place in your carriage and at your window at the rospoli palace, and i leave you at liberty to dispose of my place at the piazza del popolo.” “but i warn you, you will lose a very curious sight,” returned the count.
Perplexity: 893808384.0000

Sentence: “you will describe it to me,” replied franz, “and the recital from your lips will make as great an impression on me as if i had witnessed it.
Perplexity: 115383976.0000

Sentence: i have more than once intended witnessing an execution, but i have never been able to make up my mind; and you, albert?” “i,” replied the viscount,—“i saw castaing executed, but i think i was rather intoxicated that day, for i had quitted college the same morning, and we had passed the previous night at a tavern.” “besides, it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at paris, that you should not see one anywhere else; when you travel, it is to see everything.
Perplexity: 896894272.0000

Sentence: think what a figure you will make when you are asked, ‘how do they execute at rome?’ and you reply, ‘i do not know!’ and, besides, they say that the culprit is an infamous scoundrel, who killed with a log of wood a worthy canon who had brought him up like his own son.
Perplexity: 87113336.0000

Sentence: _diable!_ when a churchman is killed, it should be with a different weapon than a log, especially when he has behaved like a father.
Perplexity: 271524608.0000

Sentence: if you went to spain, would you not see the bull-fights?
Perplexity: 1298287616.0000

Sentence: well, suppose it is a bull-fight you are going to see?
Perplexity: 252943504.0000

Sentence: recollect the ancient romans of the circus, and the sports where they killed three hundred lions and a hundred men.
Perplexity: 342666880.0000

Sentence: think of the eighty thousand applauding spectators, the sage matrons who took their daughters, and the charming vestals who made with the thumb of their white hands the fatal sign that said, ‘come, despatch the dying.’” “shall you go, then, albert?” asked franz.
Perplexity: 322708640.0000

Sentence: “_ma foi_, yes; like you, i hesitated, but the count’s eloquence decides me.” “let us go, then,” said franz, “since you wish it; but on our way to the piazza del popolo, i wish to pass through the corso.
Perplexity: 238302416.0000

Sentence: is this possible, count?” “on foot, yes, in a carriage, no.” “i will go on foot, then.” “is it important that you should go that way?” “yes, there is something i wish to see.” “well, we will go by the corso.
Perplexity: 3492729856.0000

Sentence: we will send the carriage to wait for us on the piazza del popolo, by the via del babuino, for i shall be glad to pass, myself, through the corso, to see if some orders i have given have been executed.” “excellency,” said a servant, opening the door, “a man in the dress of a penitent wishes to speak to you.” “ah!
Perplexity: 1864666112.0000

Sentence: yes,” returned the count, “i know who he is, gentlemen; will you return to the salon?
Perplexity: 2801513472.0000

Sentence: you will find good cigars on the centre table.
Perplexity: 234568064.0000

Sentence: i will be with you directly.” the young men rose and returned into the salon, while the count, again apologizing, left by another door.
Perplexity: 133385960.0000

Sentence: albert, who was a great smoker, and who had considered it no small sacrifice to be deprived of the cigars of the café de paris, approached the table, and uttered a cry of joy at perceiving some veritable _puros_.
Perplexity: 337491424.0000

Sentence: “well,” asked franz, “what think you of the count of monte cristo?” “what do i think?” said albert, evidently surprised at such a question from his companion; “i think he is a delightful fellow, who does the honors of his table admirably; who has travelled much, read much, is, like brutus, of the stoic school, and moreover,” added he, sending a volume of smoke up towards the ceiling, “that he has excellent cigars.” such was albert’s opinion of the count, and as franz well knew that albert professed never to form an opinion except upon long reflection, he made no attempt to change it.
Perplexity: 58153428.0000

Sentence: “but,” said he, “did you observe one very singular thing?” “what?” “how attentively he looked at you.” “at me?” “yes.” albert reflected.
Perplexity: 434062272.0000

Sentence: “ah,” replied he, sighing, “that is not very surprising; i have been more than a year absent from paris, and my clothes are of a most antiquated cut; the count takes me for a provincial.
Perplexity: 162966576.0000

Sentence: the first opportunity you have, undeceive him, i beg, and tell him i am nothing of the kind.” franz smiled; an instant after the count entered.
Perplexity: 26421366.0000

Sentence: “i am now quite at your service, gentlemen,” said he.
Perplexity: 441804384.0000

Sentence: “the carriage is going one way to the piazza del popolo, and we will go another; and, if you please, by the corso.
Perplexity: 135846928.0000

Sentence: take some more of these cigars, m. de morcerf.” “with all my heart,” returned albert; “italian cigars are horrible.
Perplexity: 125855176.0000

Sentence: when you come to paris, i will return all this.” “i will not refuse; i intend going there soon, and since you allow me, i will pay you a visit.
Perplexity: 2266386176.0000

Sentence: come, we have not any time to lose, it is half-past twelve—let us set off.” all three descended; the coachman received his master’s orders, and drove down the via del babuino.
Perplexity: 2673074688.0000

Sentence: while the three gentlemen walked along the piazza di spagna and the via frattina, which led directly between the fiano and rospoli palaces, franz’s attention was directed towards the windows of that last palace, for he had not forgotten the signal agreed upon between the man in the mantle and the transtevere peasant.
Perplexity: 2042968448.0000

Sentence: “which are your windows?” asked he of the count, with as much indifference as he could assume.
Perplexity: 1125874048.0000

Sentence: “the three last,” returned he, with a negligence evidently unaffected, for he could not imagine with what intention the question was put.
Perplexity: 573672960.0000

Sentence: franz glanced rapidly towards the three windows.
Perplexity: 345777632.0000

Sentence: the side windows were hung with yellow damask, and the centre one with white damask and a red cross.
Perplexity: 416462624.0000

Sentence: the man in the mantle had kept his promise to the transteverin, and there could now be no doubt that he was the count.
Perplexity: 91839256.0000

Sentence: the three windows were still untenanted.
Perplexity: 1127378176.0000

Sentence: preparations were making on every side; chairs were placed, scaffolds were raised, and windows were hung with flags.
Perplexity: 471147680.0000

Perplexity: 280025664.0000

Sentence: franz, albert, and the count continued to descend the corso.
Perplexity: 65664852.0000

Sentence: as they approached the piazza del popolo, the crowd became more dense, and above the heads of the multitude two objects were visible: the obelisk, surmounted by a cross, which marks the centre of the square, and in front of the obelisk, at the point where the three streets, del babuino, del corso, and di ripetta, meet, the two uprights of the scaffold, between which glittered the curved knife of the _mandaïa_.
Perplexity: 51459800.0000

Sentence: at the corner of the street they met the count’s steward, who was awaiting his master.
Perplexity: 170062960.0000

Sentence: the window, let at an exorbitant price, which the count had doubtless wished to conceal from his guests, was on the second floor of the great palace, situated between the via del babuino and the monte pincio.
Perplexity: 370485120.0000

Sentence: on chairs were laid elegant masquerade costumes of blue and white satin.
Perplexity: 726243968.0000

Sentence: 20167m “as you left the choice of your costumes to me,” said the count to the two friends, “i have had these brought, as they will be the most worn this year; and they are most suitable, on account of the _confetti_ (sweetmeats), as they do not show the flour.” franz heard the words of the count but imperfectly, and he perhaps did not fully appreciate this new attention to their wishes; for he was wholly absorbed by the spectacle that the piazza del popolo presented, and by the terrible instrument that was in the centre.
Perplexity: 811111424.0000

Sentence: it was the first time franz had ever seen a guillotine,—we say guillotine, because the roman _mandaïa_ is formed on almost the same model as the french instrument.7 the knife, which is shaped like a crescent, that cuts with the convex side, falls from a less height, and that is all the difference.
Perplexity: 21606278.0000

Perplexity: 81383072.0000

Sentence: a double line of carbineers, placed on each side of the door of the church, reached to the scaffold, and formed a circle around it, leaving a path about ten feet wide, and around the guillotine a space of nearly a hundred feet.
Perplexity: 130577200.0000

Sentence: all the rest of the square was paved with heads.
Perplexity: 216394480.0000

Sentence: many women held their infants on their shoulders, and thus the children had the best view.
Perplexity: 41001980.0000

Sentence: the monte pincio seemed a vast amphitheatre filled with spectators; the balconies of the two churches at the corner of the via del babuino and the via di ripetta were crammed; the steps even seemed a parti-colored sea, that was impelled towards the portico; every niche in the wall held its living statue.

Sentence: what the count said was true—the most curious spectacle in life is that of death.

Sentence: 20169m behind the penitents came a man of vast stature and proportions.
Perplexity: 247752752.0000

Perplexity: 593524800.0000

Sentence: the count alone seemed unmoved—nay, more, a slight color seemed striving to rise in his pale cheeks.
Perplexity: 145024560.0000

Sentence: his nostrils dilated like those of a wild beast that scents its prey, and his lips, half opened, disclosed his white teeth, small and sharp like those of a jackal.
Perplexity: 217457408.0000

Sentence: and yet his features wore an expression of smiling tenderness, such as franz had never before witnessed in them; his black eyes especially were full of kindness and pity.

Perplexity: 159673760.0000

Sentence: at the moment when peppino reached the foot of the _mandaïa_, a priest arrived in some haste, forced his way through the soldiers, and, advancing to the chief of the brotherhood, gave him a folded paper.
Perplexity: 439675872.0000

Sentence: the piercing eye of peppino had noticed all.
Perplexity: 87528888.0000

Sentence: the chief took the paper, unfolded it, and, raising his hand, “heaven be praised, and his holiness also,” said he in a loud voice; “here is a pardon for one of the prisoners!” “a pardon!” cried the people with one voice; “a pardon!” at this cry andrea raised his head.

Perplexity: 40740676.0000

Sentence: it must be allowed that andrea was not very handsome, the hideous scoundrel!
Perplexity: 796438784.0000

Perplexity: 1294798336.0000

Sentence: a handful of confetti that came from a neighboring carriage, and which, while it covered morcerf and his two companions with dust, pricked his neck and that portion of his face uncovered by his mask like a hundred pins, incited him to join in the general combat, in which all the masks around him were engaged.

Perplexity: 54981532.0000

Perplexity: 430076928.0000

Sentence: in the streets the lively crowd is dressed in the most fantastic costumes—gigantic cabbages walk gravely about, buffaloes’ heads bellow from men’s shoulders, dogs walk on their hind legs; in the midst of all this a mask is lifted, and, as in callot’s temptation of st. anthony, a lovely face is exhibited, which we would fain follow, but from which we are separated by troops of fiends.

Perplexity: 60322200.0000

Sentence: in the meantime, dispose of my coachman, my carriage, and my servants.” we have forgotten to mention, that the count’s coachman was attired in a bear-skin, exactly resembling odry’s in _the bear and the pasha_; and the two footmen behind were dressed up as green monkeys, with spring masks, with which they made grimaces at everyone who passed.
Perplexity: 150890016.0000

Sentence: franz thanked the count for his attention.
Perplexity: 514679680.0000

Perplexity: 68836520.0000

Sentence: “ah, my dear fellow,” said he to franz; “you did not see?” “what?” “there,—that calash filled with roman peasants.” “no.” “well, i am convinced they are all charming women.” “how unfortunate that you were masked, albert,” said franz; “here was an opportunity of making up for past disappointments.” “oh,” replied he, half laughing, half serious; “i hope the carnival will not pass without some amends in one shape or the other.” but, in spite of albert’s hope, the day passed unmarked by any incident, excepting two or three encounters with the carriage full of roman peasants.
Perplexity: 92601056.0000

Sentence: at one of these encounters, accidentally or purposely, albert’s mask fell off.
Perplexity: 413244544.0000

Sentence: he instantly rose and cast the remainder of the bouquets into the carriage.
Perplexity: 18194208.0000

Sentence: doubtless one of the charming females albert had detected beneath their coquettish disguise was touched by his gallantry; for, as the carriage of the two friends passed her, she threw a bunch of violets.
Perplexity: 226050064.0000

Sentence: albert seized it, and as franz had no reason to suppose it was meant for him, he suffered albert to retain it.
Perplexity: 1930373888.0000

Sentence: albert placed it in his button-hole, and the carriage went triumphantly on.
Perplexity: 352022240.0000

Sentence: “well,” said franz to him; “there is the beginning of an adventure.” “laugh if you please—i really think so.
Perplexity: 58781268.0000

Sentence: so i will not abandon this bouquet.” “_pardieu_,” returned franz, laughing, “in token of your ingratitude.” the jest, however, soon appeared to become earnest; for when albert and franz again encountered the carriage with the _contadini_, the one who had thrown the violets to albert, clapped her hands when she beheld them in his button-hole.
Perplexity: 40692060.0000

Sentence: “bravo, bravo,” said franz; “things go wonderfully.

Sentence: shall i leave you?
Perplexity: 175167744.0000

Perplexity: 86905064.0000

Sentence: if the fair peasant wishes to carry matters any further, we shall find her, or rather, she will find us tomorrow; then she will give me some sign or other, and i shall know what i have to do.” “on my word,” said franz, “you are as wise as nestor and prudent as ulysses, and your fair circe must be very skilful or very powerful if she succeed in changing you into a beast of any kind.” albert was right; the fair unknown had resolved, doubtless, to carry the intrigue no farther; for although the young men made several more turns, they did not again see the calash, which had turned up one of the neighboring streets.
Perplexity: 81746952.0000

Sentence: then they returned to the rospoli palace; but the count and the blue domino had also disappeared; the two windows, hung with yellow damask, were still occupied by the persons whom the count had invited.

Perplexity: 105553408.0000

Perplexity: 356544256.0000

Sentence: “a tailor,” said the host; “and for what?” “to make us between now and tomorrow two roman peasant costumes,” returned albert.
Perplexity: 172761808.0000

Sentence: the host shook his head.
Perplexity: 87807128.0000

Sentence: “to make you two costumes between now and tomorrow?
Perplexity: 74795912.0000

Sentence: i ask your excellencies’ pardon, but this is quite a french demand; for the next week you will not find a single tailor who would consent to sew six buttons on a waistcoat if you paid him a crown a piece for each button.” “then i must give up the idea?” “no; we have them ready-made.
Perplexity: 667669248.0000

Sentence: leave all to me; and tomorrow, when you awake, you shall find a collection of costumes with which you will be satisfied.” “my dear albert,” said franz, “leave all to our host; he has already proved himself full of resources; let us dine quietly, and afterwards go and see _l’italienne à alger!_ “agreed,” returned albert; “but remember, signor pastrini, that both my friend and myself attach the greatest importance to having tomorrow the costumes we have asked for.” the host again assured them they might rely on him, and that their wishes should be attended to; upon which franz and albert mounted to their apartments, and proceeded to disencumber themselves of their costumes.
Perplexity: 27002210.0000

Sentence: albert, as he took off his dress, carefully preserved the bunch of violets; it was his token reserved for the morrow.
Perplexity: 1698393856.0000

Sentence: the two friends sat down to table; but they could not refrain from remarking the difference between the count of monte cristo’s table and that of signor pastrini.
Perplexity: 39010204.0000

Sentence: “his excellency the count of monte cristo had,” he said, “given positive orders that the carriage was to remain at their lordships’ orders all day, and they could therefore dispose of it without fear of indiscretion.” they resolved to profit by the count’s courtesy, and ordered the horses to be harnessed, while they substituted evening dress for that which they had on, and which was somewhat the worse for the numerous combats they had sustained.
Perplexity: 788095936.0000

Perplexity: 1369986688.0000

Perplexity: 155444784.0000

Sentence: her opera-glass was so fixedly directed towards them, that franz saw it would be cruel not to satisfy her curiosity; and, availing himself of one of the privileges of the spectators of the italian theatres, who use their boxes to hold receptions, the two friends went to pay their respects to the countess.
Perplexity: 109130264.0000

Sentence: scarcely had they entered, when she motioned to franz to assume the seat of honor.
Perplexity: 83777840.0000

Sentence: albert, in his turn, sat behind.

Sentence: “well,” said she, hardly giving franz time to sit down, “it seems you have nothing better to do than to make the acquaintance of this new lord ruthven, and you are already the best friends in the world.” “without being so far advanced as that, my dear countess,” returned franz, “i cannot deny that we have abused his good nature all day.” “all day?” “yes; this morning we breakfasted with him; we rode in his carriage all day, and now we have taken possession of his box.” “you know him, then?” “yes, and no.” “how so?” “it is a long story.” “tell it to me.” “it would frighten you too much.” “so much the more reason.” “at least wait until the story has a conclusion.” “very well; i prefer complete histories; but tell me how you made his acquaintance?
Perplexity: 528680864.0000

Sentence: did anyone introduce you to him?” “no; it was he who introduced himself to us.” “when?” “last night, after we left you.” “through what medium?” “the very prosaic one of our landlord.” “he is staying, then, at the hôtel de londres with you?” “not only in the same hotel, but on the same floor.” “what is his name; for, of course, you know?” “the count of monte cristo.” “that is not a family name?” “no, it is the name of the island he has purchased.” “and he is a count?” “a tuscan count.” “well, we must put up with that,” said the countess, who was herself from one of the oldest venetian families.
Perplexity: 902404160.0000

Sentence: “what sort of a man is he?” “ask the vicomte de morcerf.” “you hear, m. de morcerf, i am referred to you,” said the countess.
Perplexity: 48663760.0000

Sentence: “we should be very hard to please, madam,” returned albert, “did we not think him delightful.
Perplexity: 644649856.0000

Sentence: a friend of ten years’ standing could not have done more for us, or with a more perfect courtesy.” “come,” observed the countess, smiling, “i see my vampire is only some millionaire, who has taken the appearance of lara in order to avoid being confounded with m. de rothschild; and you have seen her?” “her?” 20183m “the beautiful greek of yesterday.” “no; we heard, i think, the sound of her _guzla_, but she remained perfectly invisible.” “when you say invisible,” interrupted albert, “it is only to keep up the mystery; for whom do you take the blue domino at the window with the white curtains?” “where was this window with white hangings?” asked the countess.
Perplexity: 105876024.0000

Sentence: “at the rospoli palace.” “the count had three windows at the rospoli palace?” “yes.

Perplexity: 192408352.0000

Sentence: do you know what those three windows were worth?” “two or three hundred roman crowns?” “two or three thousand.” “the deuce!” “does his island produce him such a revenue?” “it does not bring him a bajocco.” “then why did he purchase it?” “for a whim.” “he is an original, then?” “in reality,” observed albert, “he seemed to me somewhat eccentric; were he at paris, and a frequenter of the theatres, i should say he was a poor devil literally mad.
Perplexity: 1020763136.0000

Sentence: this morning he made two or three exits worthy of didier or anthony.” at this moment a fresh visitor entered, and, according to custom, franz gave up his seat to him.
Perplexity: 396986048.0000

Perplexity: 31160372.0000

Perplexity: 115233760.0000

Sentence: albert was impatient to see how he looked in his new dress—a jacket and breeches of blue velvet, silk stockings with clocks, shoes with buckles, and a silk waistcoat.
Perplexity: 213876672.0000

Sentence: “come,” said the count, smiling with his own peculiar smile, “not so bad for a man who is to be shot at seven o’clock tomorrow morning.” vampa looked at albert with a kind of admiration; he was not insensible to such a proof of courage.
Perplexity: 116546968.0000

Sentence: “you are right, your excellency,” he said; “this must be one of your friends.” then going to albert, he touched him on the shoulder, saying, “will your excellency please to awaken?” albert stretched out his arms, rubbed his eyelids, and opened his eyes.

Sentence: “what,” said he, “is it you, my dear franz, whose devotion and friendship are thus displayed?” “no, not i,” replied franz, “but our neighbor, the count of monte cristo.” “oh, my dear count,” said albert gayly, arranging his cravat and wristbands, “you are really most kind, and i hope you will consider me as under eternal obligations to you, in the first place for the carriage, and in the next for this visit,” and he put out his hand to the count, who shuddered as he gave his own, but who nevertheless did give it.
Perplexity: 169996800.0000

Perplexity: 470210432.0000

Sentence: they advanced to the plain.
Perplexity: 795078784.0000

Perplexity: 1144171264.0000

Sentence: in the meanwhile franz was considering the singular shudder that had passed over the count of monte cristo at the moment when he had been, in some sort, forced to give his hand to albert.
Perplexity: 325219808.0000

Sentence: the rendezvous the first words that albert uttered to his friend, on the following morning, contained a request that franz would accompany him on a visit to the count; true, the young man had warmly and energetically thanked the count on the previous evening; but services such as he had rendered could never be too often acknowledged.
Perplexity: 75657528.0000

Sentence: franz, who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count, in which terror was strangely mingled, felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him, and therefore made no objection to albert’s request, but at once accompanied him to the desired spot, and, after a short delay, the count joined them in the salon.
Perplexity: 2272948992.0000

Sentence: “my dear count,” said albert, advancing to meet him, “permit me to repeat the poor thanks i offered last night, and to assure you that the remembrance of all i owe to you will never be effaced from my memory; believe me, as long as i live, i shall never cease to dwell with grateful recollection on the prompt and important service you rendered me; and also to remember that to you i am indebted even for my life.” “my very good friend and excellent neighbor,” replied the count, with a smile, “you really exaggerate my trifling exertions.
Perplexity: 877996352.0000

Sentence: you owe me nothing but some trifle of 20,000 francs, which you have been saved out of your travelling expenses, so that there is not much of a score between us;—but you must really permit me to congratulate you on the ease and unconcern with which you resigned yourself to your fate, and the perfect indifference you manifested as to the turn events might take.” “upon my word,” said albert, “i deserve no credit for what i could not help, namely, a determination to take everything as i found it, and to let those bandits see, that although men get into troublesome scrapes all over the world, there is no nation but the french that can smile even in the face of grim death himself.
Perplexity: 295546656.0000

Sentence: all that, however, has nothing to do with my obligations to you, and i now come to ask you whether, in my own person, my family, or connections, i can in any way serve you?
Perplexity: 57254680.0000

Sentence: my father, the comte de morcerf, although of spanish origin, possesses considerable influence, both at the court of france and madrid, and i unhesitatingly place the best services of myself, and all to whom my life is dear, at your disposal.” “monsieur de morcerf,” replied the count, “your offer, far from surprising me, is precisely what i expected from you, and i accept it in the same spirit of hearty sincerity with which it is made;—nay, i will go still further, and say that i had previously made up my mind to ask a great favor at your hands.” “oh, pray name it.” “i am wholly a stranger to paris—it is a city i have never yet seen.” “is it possible,” exclaimed albert, “that you have reached your present age without visiting the finest capital in the world?
Perplexity: 225489408.0000

Sentence: i can scarcely credit it.” “nevertheless, it is quite true; still, i agree with you in thinking that my present ignorance of the first city in europe is a reproach to me in every way, and calls for immediate correction; but, in all probability, i should have performed so important, so necessary a duty, as that of making myself acquainted with the wonders and beauties of your justly celebrated capital, had i known any person who would have introduced me into the fashionable world, but unfortunately i possessed no acquaintance there, and, of necessity, was compelled to abandon the idea.” “so distinguished an individual as yourself,” cried albert, “could scarcely have required an introduction.” “you are most kind; but as regards myself, i can find no merit i possess, save that, as a millionaire, i might have become a partner in the speculations of m. aguado and m. rothschild; but as my motive in travelling to your capital would not have been for the pleasure of dabbling in stocks, i stayed away till some favorable chance should present itself of carrying my wish into execution.
Perplexity: 233516336.0000

Sentence: your offer, however, smooths all difficulties, and i have only to ask you, my dear m. de morcerf” (these words were accompanied by a most peculiar smile), “whether you undertake, upon my arrival in france, to open to me the doors of that fashionable world of which i know no more than a huron or a native of cochin-china?” “oh, that i do, and with infinite pleasure,” answered albert; “and so much the more readily as a letter received this morning from my father summons me to paris, in consequence of a treaty of marriage (my dear franz, do not smile, i beg of you) with a family of high standing, and connected with the very cream of parisian society.” “connected by marriage, you mean,” said franz, laughingly.
Perplexity: 369182208.0000

Sentence: “well, never mind how it is,” answered albert, “it comes to the same thing in the end.
Perplexity: 239937472.0000

Perplexity: 345343904.0000

Sentence: a most edifying representative i shall make of all the domestic virtues—don’t you think so?
Perplexity: 94793952.0000

Sentence: but as regards your wish to visit our fine city, my dear count, i can only say that you may command me and mine to any extent you please.” “then it is settled,” said the count, “and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that i have long meditated.” franz did not doubt that these plans were the same concerning which the count had dropped a few words in the grotto of monte cristo, and while the count was speaking the young man watched him closely, hoping to read something of his purpose in his face, but his countenance was inscrutable especially when, as in the present case, it was veiled in a sphinx-like smile.
Perplexity: 166758688.0000

Sentence: “but tell me now, count,” exclaimed albert, delighted at the idea of having to chaperon so distinguished a person as monte cristo; “tell me truly whether you are in earnest, or if this project of visiting paris is merely one of the chimerical and uncertain air castles of which we make so many in the course of our lives, but which, like a house built on the sand, is liable to be blown over by the first puff of wind?” “i pledge you my honor,” returned the count, “that i mean to do as i have said; both inclination and positive necessity compel me to visit paris.” “when do you propose going thither?” “have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself?” “certainly i have; in a fortnight or three weeks’ time, that is to say, as fast as i can get there!” “nay,” said the count; “i will give you three months ere i join you; you see i make an ample allowance for all delays and difficulties.
Perplexity: 231135888.0000

Sentence: “and in three months’ time,” said albert, “you will be at my house?” “shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour?” inquired the count; “only let me warn you that i am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements.” “day for day, hour for hour,” said albert; “that will suit me to a dot.” “so be it, then,” replied the count, and extending his hand towards a calendar, suspended near the chimney-piece, he said, “today is the 21st of february;” and drawing out his watch, added, “it is exactly half-past ten o’clock.
Perplexity: 291650304.0000

Sentence: now promise me to remember this, and expect me the 21st of may at the same hour in the forenoon.” “capital!” exclaimed albert; “your breakfast shall be waiting.” “where do you live?” “no.

Sentence: 27, rue du helder.” “have you bachelor’s apartments there?
Perplexity: 149364384.0000

Sentence: i hope my coming will not put you to any inconvenience.” “i reside in my father’s house, but occupy a pavilion at the farther side of the courtyard, entirely separated from the main building.” “quite sufficient,” replied the count, as, taking out his tablets, he wrote down “no.
Perplexity: 122724432.0000

Sentence: 27, rue du helder, 21st may, half-past ten in the morning.” “now then,” said the count, returning his tablets to his pocket, “make yourself perfectly easy; the hand of your time-piece will not be more accurate in marking the time than myself.” “shall i see you again ere my departure?” asked albert.
Perplexity: 138379456.0000

Sentence: “that depends; when do you leave?” “tomorrow evening, at five o’clock.” “in that case i must say adieu to you, as i am compelled to go to naples, and shall not return hither before saturday evening or sunday morning.
Perplexity: 1674833152.0000

Sentence: and you, baron,” pursued the count, addressing franz, “do you also depart tomorrow?” “yes.” “for france?” “no, for venice; i shall remain in italy for another year or two.” “then we shall not meet in paris?” “i fear i shall not have that honor.” “well, since we must part,” said the count, holding out a hand to each of the young men, “allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey.” it was the first time the hand of franz had come in contact with that of the mysterious individual before him, and unconsciously he shuddered at its touch, for it felt cold and icy as that of a corpse.
Perplexity: 163990560.0000

Sentence: 20219m “let us understand each other,” said albert; “it is agreed—is it not?—that you are to be at no.

Perplexity: 244461760.0000

Sentence: “what is the matter?” asked albert of franz, when they had returned to their own apartments; “you seem more than commonly thoughtful.” “i will confess to you, albert,” replied franz, “the count is a very singular person, and the appointment you have made to meet him in paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions.” “my dear fellow,” exclaimed albert, “what can there possibly be in that to excite uneasiness?
Perplexity: 91218456.0000

Sentence: why, you must have lost your senses.” “whether i am in my senses or not,” answered franz, “that is the way i feel.” “listen to me, franz,” said albert; “i am glad that the occasion has presented itself for saying this to you, for i have noticed how cold you are in your bearing towards the count, while he, on the other hand, has always been courtesy itself to us.
Perplexity: 4833569280.0000

Sentence: have you anything particular against him?” “possibly.” “did you ever meet him previously to coming hither?” “i have.” “and where?” “will you promise me not to repeat a single word of what i am about to tell you?” “i promise.” “upon your honor?” “upon my honor.” “then listen to me.” franz then related to his friend the history of his excursion to the island of monte cristo and of his finding a party of smugglers there, and the two corsican bandits with them.
Perplexity: 116369040.0000

Sentence: now, by way of having a resting-place during his excursions, avoiding the wretched cookery—which has been trying its best to poison me during the last four months, while you have manfully resisted its effects for as many years,—and obtaining a bed on which it is possible to slumber, monte cristo has furnished for himself a temporary abode where you first found him; but, to prevent the possibility of the tuscan government taking a fancy to his enchanted palace, and thereby depriving him of the advantages naturally expected from so large an outlay of capital, he has wisely enough purchased the island, and taken its name.

Perplexity: 41609716.0000

Sentence: nobody knows better than yourself that the bandits of corsica are not rogues or thieves, but purely and simply fugitives, driven by some sinister motive from their native town or village, and that their fellowship involves no disgrace or stigma; for my own part, i protest that, should i ever go to corsica, my first visit, ere even i presented myself to the mayor or prefect, should be to the bandits of colomba, if i could only manage to find them; for, on my conscience, they are a race of men i admire greatly.” “still,” persisted franz, “i suppose you will allow that such men as vampa and his band are regular villains, who have no other motive than plunder when they seize your person.

Perplexity: 503825568.0000

Perplexity: 498903680.0000

Sentence: this door was a mockery to the _concierge_, from whose vigilance and jurisdiction it was free, and, like that famous portal in the _arabian nights_, opening at the “_sesame_” of ali baba, it was wont to swing backward at a cabalistic word or a concerted tap from without from the sweetest voices or whitest fingers in the world.

Sentence: in the centre of the room was a roller and blanchet “baby grand” piano in rosewood, but holding the potentialities of an orchestra in its narrow and sonorous cavity, and groaning beneath the weight of the _chefs-d’œuvre_ of beethoven, weber, mozart, haydn, grétry, and porpora.

Perplexity: 89666120.0000

Sentence: you have seven martlets on your arms; give three to your wife, and you will still have four; that is one more than m. de guise had, who so nearly became king of france, and whose cousin was emperor of germany.” “on my word, i think you are right, lucien,” said albert absently.
Perplexity: 111828216.0000

Sentence: “to be sure; besides, every millionaire is as noble as a bastard—that is, he can be.” “do not say that, debray,” returned beauchamp, laughing, “for here is château-renaud, who, to cure you of your mania for paradoxes, will pass the sword of renaud de montauban, his ancestor, through your body.” “he will sully it then,” returned lucien; “for i am low—very low.” “oh, heavens,” cried beauchamp, “the minister quotes béranger, what shall we come to next?” “m.

Perplexity: 571522624.0000

Sentence: “now, then, to breakfast,” said beauchamp; “for, if i remember, you told me you only expected two persons, albert.” “morrel,” muttered albert—“morrel—who is he?” but before he had finished, m. de château-renaud, a handsome young man of thirty, gentleman all over,—that is, with the figure of a guiche and the wit of a mortemart,—took albert’s hand.
Perplexity: 288517024.0000

Sentence: “my dear albert,” said he, “let me introduce to you m. maximilian morrel, captain of spahis, my friend; and what is more—however the man speaks for himself—my preserver.
Perplexity: 985316288.0000

Sentence: salute my hero, viscount.” and he stepped on one side to give place to a young man of refined and dignified bearing, with large and open brow, piercing eyes, and black moustache, whom our readers have already seen at marseilles, under circumstances sufficiently dramatic not to be forgotten.

Perplexity: 2588284416.0000

Sentence: “oh, nothing worth speaking of,” said morrel; “m.
Perplexity: 336369376.0000

Sentence: de château-renaud exaggerates.” “not worth speaking of?” cried château-renaud; “life is not worth speaking of!—that is rather too philosophical, on my word, morrel.
Perplexity: 163111184.0000

Sentence: it is very well for you, who risk your life every day, but for me, who only did so once——” “we gather from all this, baron, that captain morrel saved your life.” “exactly so.” “on what occasion?” asked beauchamp.
Perplexity: 60051624.0000

Sentence: “beauchamp, my good fellow, you know i am starving,” said debray: “do not set him off on some long story.” “well, i do not prevent your sitting down to table,” replied beauchamp, “château-renaud can tell us while we eat our breakfast.” “gentlemen,” said morcerf, “it is only a quarter past ten, and i expect someone else.” “ah, true, a diplomatist!” observed debray.
Perplexity: 165522512.0000

Sentence: “diplomat or not, i don’t know; i only know that he charged himself on my account with a mission, which he terminated so entirely to my satisfaction, that had i been king, i should have instantly created him knight of all my orders, even had i been able to offer him the golden fleece and the garter.” “well, since we are not to sit down to table,” said debray, “take a glass of sherry, and tell us all about it.” “you all know that i had the fancy of going to africa.” “it is a road your ancestors have traced for you,” said albert gallantly.

Perplexity: 811074304.0000

Sentence: poor brute—accustomed to be covered up and to have a stove in the stable, the arabian finds himself unable to bear ten degrees of cold in arabia.” “that’s why you want to purchase my english horse,” said debray, “you think he will bear the cold better.” “you are mistaken, for i have made a vow never to return to africa.” “you were very much frightened, then?” asked beauchamp.
Perplexity: 561835136.0000

Perplexity: 30400587776.0000

Sentence: i shot two with my double-barrelled gun, and two more with my pistols, but i was then disarmed, and two were still left; one seized me by the hair (that is why i now wear it so short, for no one knows what may happen), the other swung a yataghan, and i already felt the cold steel on my neck, when this gentleman whom you see here charged them, shot the one who held me by the hair, and cleft the skull of the other with his sabre.
Perplexity: 621335168.0000

Perplexity: 169408336.0000

Sentence: “i was chosen.
Perplexity: 3152994048.0000

Sentence: but that is not all—after rescuing me from the sword, he rescued me from the cold, not by sharing his cloak with me, like st. martin, but by giving me the whole; then from hunger by sharing with me—guess what?” “a strasbourg pie?” asked beauchamp.
Perplexity: 1050076736.0000

Sentence: “no, his horse; of which we each of us ate a slice with a hearty appetite.

Sentence: it was very hard.” “the horse?” said morcerf, laughing.
Perplexity: 190267216.0000

Sentence: “no, the sacrifice,” returned château-renaud; “ask debray if he would sacrifice his english steed for a stranger?” “not for a stranger,” said debray, “but for a friend i might, perhaps.” “i divined that you would become mine, count,” replied morrel; “besides, as i had the honor to tell you, heroism or not, sacrifice or not, that day i owed an offering to bad fortune in recompense for the favors good fortune had on other days granted to us.” “the history to which m. morrel alludes,” continued château-renaud, “is an admirable one, which he will tell you some day when you are better acquainted with him; today let us fill our stomachs, and not our memories.
Perplexity: 478568096.0000

Sentence: what time do you breakfast, albert?” “at half-past ten.” “precisely?” asked debray, taking out his watch.

Sentence: “oh, you will give me five minutes’ grace,” replied morcerf, “for i also expect a preserver.” “of whom?” “of myself,” cried morcerf; “_parbleu!_ do you think i cannot be saved as well as anyone else, and that there are only arabs who cut off heads?
Perplexity: 134840432.0000

Sentence: our breakfast is a philanthropic one, and we shall have at table—at least, i hope so—two benefactors of humanity.” “what shall we do?” said debray; “we have only one monthyon prize.” “well, it will be given to someone who has done nothing to deserve it,” said beauchamp; “that is the way the academy mostly escapes from the dilemma.” “and where does he come from?” asked debray.
Perplexity: 795715968.0000

Sentence: “you have already answered the question once, but so vaguely that i venture to put it a second time.” “really,” said albert, “i do not know; when i invited him three months ago, he was then at rome, but since that time who knows where he may have gone?” “and you think him capable of being exact?” demanded debray.
Perplexity: 247567104.0000

Sentence: “i think him capable of everything.” “well, with the five minutes’ grace, we have only ten left.” “i will profit by them to tell you something about my guest.” “i beg pardon,” interrupted beauchamp; “are there any materials for an article in what you are going to tell us?” “yes, and for a most curious one.” “go on, then, for i see i shall not get to the chamber this morning, and i must make up for it.” “i was at rome during the last carnival.” “we know that,” said beauchamp.
Perplexity: 144342400.0000

Sentence: “yes, but what you do not know is that i was carried off by bandits.” “there are no bandits,” cried debray.
Perplexity: 252837376.0000

Sentence: “yes there are, and most hideous, or rather most admirable ones, for i found them ugly enough to frighten me.” “come, my dear albert,” said debray, “confess that your cook is behindhand, that the oysters have not arrived from ostend or marennes, and that, like madame de maintenon, you are going to replace the dish by a story.
Perplexity: 88271768.0000

Sentence: say so at once; we are sufficiently well-bred to excuse you, and to listen to your history, fabulous as it promises to be.” “and i say to you, fabulous as it may seem, i tell it as a true one from beginning to end.
Perplexity: 31416450.0000

Sentence: the brigands had carried me off, and conducted me to a gloomy spot, called the catacombs of saint sebastian.” “i know it,” said château-renaud; “i narrowly escaped catching a fever there.” “and i did more than that,” replied morcerf, “for i caught one.
Perplexity: 401837280.0000

Perplexity: 33040160.0000

Sentence: “a man whose name is franz d’épinay or albert de morcerf has not much difficulty in procuring them.” “no, he arrived accompanied simply by the guest i am going to present to you.” “ah, this gentleman is a hercules killing cacus, a perseus freeing andromeda.” “no, he is a man about my own size.” “armed to the teeth?” “he had not even a knitting-needle.” “but he paid your ransom?” “he said two words to the chief and i was free.” “and they apologized to him for having carried you off?” said beauchamp.
Perplexity: 51471580.0000

Perplexity: 3760526592.0000

Perplexity: 83453608.0000

Sentence: “does anyone know anything of a count of monte cristo?” “he comes possibly from the holy land, and one of his ancestors possessed calvary, as the mortemarts did the dead sea.” “i think i can assist your researches,” said maximilian.
Perplexity: 1514003584.0000

Sentence: “monte cristo is a little island i have often heard spoken of by the old sailors my father employed—a grain of sand in the centre of the mediterranean, an atom in the infinite.” “precisely!” cried albert.
Perplexity: 974894400.0000

Sentence: “well, he of whom i speak is the lord and master of this grain of sand, of this atom; he has purchased the title of count somewhere in tuscany.” “he is rich, then?” “i believe so.” “but that ought to be visible.” “that is what deceives you, debray.” “i do not understand you.” “have you read the _arabian nights_?” “what a question!” “well, do you know if the persons you see there are rich or poor, if their sacks of wheat are not rubies or diamonds?
Perplexity: 110576200.0000

Sentence: they seem like poor fishermen, and suddenly they open some mysterious cavern filled with the wealth of the indies.” “which means?” “which means that my count of monte cristo is one of those fishermen.
Perplexity: 101240376.0000

Sentence: he has even a name taken from the book, since he calls himself sinbad the sailor, and has a cave filled with gold.” “and you have seen this cavern, morcerf?” asked beauchamp.
Perplexity: 204602480.0000

Perplexity: 819024384.0000

Perplexity: 287214112.0000

Sentence: only he is not quite sure about the women, for they did not come in until after he had taken hashish, so that what he took for women might have been simply a row of statues.” the two young men looked at morcerf as if to say,—“are you mad, or are you laughing at us?” “and i also,” said morrel thoughtfully, “have heard something like this from an old sailor named penelon.” “ah,” cried albert, “it is very lucky that m. morrel comes to aid me; you are vexed, are you not, that he thus gives a clew to the labyrinth?” “my dear albert,” said debray, “what you tell us is so extraordinary.” “ah, because your ambassadors and your consuls do not tell you of them—they have no time.
Perplexity: 380578176.0000

Sentence: they are too much taken up with interfering in the affairs of their countrymen who travel.” “now you get angry, and attack our poor agents.

Sentence: will you be ambassador, albert?
Perplexity: 134876176.0000

Sentence: i will send you to constantinople.” “no, lest on the first demonstration i make in favor of mehemet ali, the sultan send me the bowstring, and make my secretaries strangle me.” “you say very true,” responded debray.
Perplexity: 277252512.0000

Sentence: “yes,” said albert, “but this has nothing to do with the existence of the count of monte cristo.” “_pardieu!_ everyone exists.” “doubtless, but not in the same way; everyone has not black slaves, a princely retinue, an arsenal of weapons that would do credit to an arabian fortress, horses that cost six thousand francs apiece, and greek mistresses.” “have you seen the greek mistress?” “i have both seen and heard her.
Perplexity: 222268496.0000

Sentence: i saw her at the theatre, and heard her one morning when i breakfasted with the count.” “he eats, then?” “yes; but so little, it can hardly be called eating.” “he must be a vampire.” “laugh, if you will; the countess g——, who knew lord ruthven, declared that the count was a vampire.” “ah, capital,” said beauchamp.
Perplexity: 201521088.0000

Sentence: “for a man not connected with newspapers, here is the pendant to the famous sea-serpent of the _constitutionnel_.” “wild eyes, the iris of which contracts or dilates at pleasure,” said debray; “facial angle strongly developed, magnificent forehead, livid complexion, black beard, sharp and white teeth, politeness unexceptionable.” “just so, lucien,” returned morcerf; “you have described him feature for feature.
Perplexity: 101624600.0000

Sentence: yes, keen and cutting politeness.
Perplexity: 123418792.0000

Sentence: this man has often made me shudder; and one day when we were viewing an execution, i thought i should faint, more from hearing the cold and calm manner in which he spoke of every description of torture, than from the sight of the executioner and the culprit.” “did he not conduct you to the ruins of the colosseum and suck your blood?” asked beauchamp.
Perplexity: 72788144.0000

Sentence: “or, having delivered you, make you sign a flaming parchment, surrendering your soul to him as esau did his birth-right?” “rail on, rail on at your ease, gentlemen,” said morcerf, somewhat piqued.
Perplexity: 662330688.0000

Sentence: “when i look at you parisians, idlers on the boulevard de gand or the bois de boulogne, and think of this man, it seems to me we are not of the same race.” “i am highly flattered,” returned beauchamp.
Perplexity: 1389359616.0000

Sentence: “at the same time,” added château-renaud, “your count of monte cristo is a very fine fellow, always excepting his little arrangements with the italian banditti.” “there are no italian banditti,” said debray.

Perplexity: 214002352.0000

Sentence: but the sound of the clock had not died away when germain announced, “his excellency the count of monte cristo.” the involuntary start everyone gave proved how much morcerf’s narrative had impressed them, and albert himself could not wholly refrain from manifesting sudden emotion.
Perplexity: 211209232.0000

Sentence: he had not heard a carriage stop in the street, or steps in the antechamber; the door had itself opened noiselessly.
Perplexity: 1482875008.0000

Sentence: the count appeared, dressed with the greatest simplicity, but the most fastidious dandy could have found nothing to cavil at in his toilet.
Perplexity: 381840416.0000

Sentence: every article of dress—hat, coat, gloves, and boots—was from the first makers.
Perplexity: 101738056.0000

Perplexity: 229356416.0000

Sentence: the count advanced, smiling, into the centre of the room, and approached albert, who hastened towards him holding out his hand in a ceremonial manner.
Perplexity: 81739152.0000

Sentence: “punctuality,” said monte cristo, “is the politeness of kings, according to one of your sovereigns, i think; but it is not the same with travellers.
Perplexity: 2447959808.0000

Sentence: however, i hope you will excuse the two or three seconds i am behindhand; five hundred leagues are not to be accomplished without some trouble, and especially in france, where, it seems, it is forbidden to beat the postilions.” “my dear count,” replied albert, “i was announcing your visit to some of my friends, whom i had invited in consequence of the promise you did me the honor to make, and whom i now present to you.
Perplexity: 155420480.0000

Sentence: they are the count of château-renaud, whose nobility goes back to the twelve peers, and whose ancestors had a place at the round table; m. lucien debray, private secretary to the minister of the interior; m. beauchamp, an editor of a paper, and the terror of the french government, but of whom, in spite of his national celebrity, you perhaps have not heard in italy, since his paper is prohibited there; and m. maximilian morrel, captain of spahis.” at this name the count, who had hitherto saluted everyone with courtesy, but at the same time with coldness and formality, stepped a pace forward, and a slight tinge of red colored his pale cheeks.
Perplexity: 89725488.0000

Sentence: “you wear the uniform of the new french conquerors, monsieur,” said he; “it is a handsome uniform.” no one could have said what caused the count’s voice to vibrate so deeply, and what made his eye flash, which was in general so clear, lustrous, and limpid when he pleased.
Perplexity: 67045348.0000

Sentence: “you have never seen our africans, count?” said albert.
Perplexity: 1183029120.0000

Sentence: “never,” replied the count, who was by this time perfectly master of himself again.
Perplexity: 25343354.0000

Sentence: “well, beneath this uniform beats one of the bravest and noblest hearts in the whole army.” “oh, m. de morcerf,” interrupted morrel.
Perplexity: 405938592.0000

Sentence: “let me go on, captain.
Perplexity: 409569792.0000

Sentence: and we have just heard,” continued albert, “of a new deed of his, and so heroic a one, that, although i have seen him today for the first time, i request you to allow me to introduce him as my friend.” at these words it was still possible to observe in monte cristo the concentrated look, changing color, and slight trembling of the eyelid that show emotion.
Perplexity: 1470779520.0000

Sentence: “ah, you have a noble heart,” said the count; “so much the better.” this exclamation, which corresponded to the count’s own thought rather than to what albert was saying, surprised everybody, and especially morrel, who looked at monte cristo with wonder.
Perplexity: 80473440.0000

Sentence: but, at the same time, the intonation was so soft that, however strange the speech might seem, it was impossible to be offended at it.
Perplexity: 1181840640.0000

Sentence: 20245m “why should he doubt it?” said beauchamp to château-renaud.
Perplexity: 229275040.0000

Sentence: “in reality,” replied the latter, who, with his aristocratic glance and his knowledge of the world, had penetrated at once all that was penetrable in monte cristo, “albert has not deceived us, for the count is a most singular being.
Perplexity: 27939704.0000

Sentence: what say you, morrel!” “_ma foi_, he has an open look about him that pleases me, in spite of the singular remark he has made about me.” “gentlemen,” said albert, “germain informs me that breakfast is ready.
Perplexity: 425592096.0000

Sentence: my dear count, allow me to show you the way.” they passed silently into the breakfast-room, and everyone took his place.
Perplexity: 2450529024.0000

Sentence: “gentlemen,” said the count, seating himself, “permit me to make a confession which must form my excuse for any improprieties i may commit.
Perplexity: 694692736.0000

Sentence: i am a stranger, and a stranger to such a degree, that this is the first time i have ever been at paris.
Perplexity: 255574384.0000

Sentence: the french way of living is utterly unknown to me, and up to the present time i have followed the eastern customs, which are entirely in contrast to the parisian.
Perplexity: 165598288.0000

Sentence: i beg you, therefore, to excuse if you find anything in me too turkish, too italian, or too arabian.
Perplexity: 241422064.0000

Sentence: now, then, let us breakfast.” “with what an air he says all this,” muttered beauchamp; “decidedly he is a great man.” “a great man in his own country,” added debray.
Perplexity: 94847480.0000

Sentence: “a great man in every country, m. debray,” said château-renaud.
Perplexity: 680047488.0000

Sentence: the count was, it may be remembered, a most temperate guest.
Perplexity: 534949536.0000

Sentence: albert remarked this, expressing his fears lest, at the outset, the parisian mode of life should displease the traveller in the most essential point.
Perplexity: 72930864.0000

Sentence: “my dear count,” said he, “i fear one thing, and that is, that the fare of the rue du helder is not so much to your taste as that of the piazza di spagna.
Perplexity: 452707808.0000

Sentence: i ought to have consulted you on the point, and have had some dishes prepared expressly.” “did you know me better,” returned the count, smiling, “you would not give one thought of such a thing for a traveller like myself, who has successively lived on macaroni at naples, polenta at milan, olla podrida at valencia, pilau at constantinople, curry in india, and swallows’ nests in china.
Perplexity: 1047486208.0000

Sentence: i eat everywhere, and of everything, only i eat but little; and today, that you reproach me with my want of appetite, is my day of appetite, for i have not eaten since yesterday morning.” “what,” cried all the guests, “you have not eaten for four-and-twenty hours?” “no,” replied the count; “i was forced to go out of my road to obtain some information near nîmes, so that i was somewhat late, and therefore i did not choose to stop.” “and you ate in your carriage?” asked morcerf.
Perplexity: 450090496.0000

Sentence: “yes.” “you have a recipe for it?” “an infallible one.” “that would be invaluable to us in africa, who have not always any food to eat, and rarely anything to drink.” “yes,” said monte cristo; “but, unfortunately, a recipe excellent for a man like myself would be very dangerous applied to an army, which might not awake when it was needed.” “may we inquire what is this recipe?” asked debray.

Sentence: “and is it your cook who prepares these pills?” asked beauchamp.
Perplexity: 945161472.0000

Perplexity: 480897728.0000

Sentence: i kept the third for myself, and i had it hollowed out, which reduced its value, but rendered it more commodious for the purpose i intended.” everyone looked at monte cristo with astonishment; he spoke with so much simplicity that it was evident he spoke the truth, or that he was mad.

Perplexity: 36859592.0000

Sentence: tell them yourself that i was taken by bandits, and that without your generous intercession i should now have been sleeping in the catacombs of st. sebastian, instead of receiving them in my humble abode in the rue du helder.” “ah,” said monte cristo “you promised me never to mention that circumstance.” “it was not i who made that promise,” cried morcerf; “it must have been someone else whom you have rescued in the same manner, and whom you have forgotten.
Perplexity: 229400160.0000

Sentence: pray speak of it, for i shall not only, i trust, relate the little i do know, but also a great deal i do not know.” “it seems to me,” returned the count, smiling, “that you played a sufficiently important part to know as well as myself what happened.” 20249m “well, you promise me, if i tell all i know, to relate, in your turn, all that i do not know?” “that is but fair,” replied monte cristo.

Perplexity: 1114135424.0000

Sentence: what i know is, that, like a fool, a greater fool than he of whom i spoke just now, i mistook for this peasant girl a young bandit of fifteen or sixteen, with a beardless chin and slim waist, and who, just as i was about to imprint a chaste salute on his lips, placed a pistol to my head, and, aided by seven or eight others, led, or rather dragged me, to the catacombs of st. sebastian, where i found a highly educated brigand chief perusing cæsar’s _commentaries_, and who deigned to leave off reading to inform me, that unless the next morning, before six o’clock, four thousand piastres were paid into his account at his banker’s, at a quarter past six i should have ceased to exist.

Perplexity: 247323584.0000

Sentence: i might have handed him over to roman justice, which is somewhat expeditious, and which would have been particularly so with him; but i did nothing of the sort—i suffered him and his band to depart.” “with the condition that they should sin no more,” said beauchamp, laughing.
Perplexity: 158701248.0000

Sentence: “i see they kept their promise.” “no, monsieur,” returned monte cristo “upon the simple condition that they should respect myself and my friends.
Perplexity: 235813792.0000

Sentence: perhaps what i am about to say may seem strange to you, who are socialists, and vaunt humanity and your duty to your neighbor, but i never seek to protect a society which does not protect me, and which i will even say, generally occupies itself about me only to injure me; and thus by giving them a low place in my esteem, and preserving a neutrality towards them, it is society and my neighbor who are indebted to me.” “bravo,” cried château-renaud; “you are the first man i ever met sufficiently courageous to preach egotism.

Perplexity: 244272544.0000

Perplexity: 117494216.0000

Sentence: “why, it seems to me,” replied morrel, “that in delivering m. de morcerf, whom you did not know, you did good to your neighbor and to society.” “of which he is the brightest ornament,” said beauchamp, drinking off a glass of champagne.

Sentence: “my dear count,” cried morcerf, “you are at fault—you, one of the most formidable logicians i know—and you must see it clearly proved that instead of being an egotist, you are a philanthropist.
Perplexity: 146396368.0000

Sentence: ah, you call yourself oriental, a levantine, maltese, indian, chinese; your family name is monte cristo; sinbad the sailor is your baptismal appellation, and yet the first day you set foot in paris you instinctively display the greatest virtue, or rather the chief defect, of us eccentric parisians,—that is, you assume the vices you have not, and conceal the virtues you possess.” “my dear vicomte,” returned monte cristo, “i do not see, in all i have done, anything that merits, either from you or these gentlemen, the pretended eulogies i have received.
Perplexity: 493305728.0000

Sentence: you were no stranger to me, for i knew you from the time i gave up two rooms to you, invited you to breakfast with me, lent you one of my carriages, witnessed the carnival in your company, and saw with you from a window in the piazza del popolo the execution that affected you so much that you nearly fainted.
Perplexity: 2624029184.0000

Perplexity: 775296192.0000

Sentence: amongst us you will not meet with any of those episodes with which your adventurous existence has so familiarized you; our chimborazo is mortmartre, our himalaya is mount valérien, our great desert is the plain of grenelle, where they are now boring an artesian well to water the caravans.
Perplexity: 176934320.0000

Sentence: we have plenty of thieves, though not so many as is said; but these thieves stand in far more dread of a policeman than a lord.
Perplexity: 109686608.0000

Sentence: france is so prosaic, and paris so civilized a city, that you will not find in its eighty-five departments—i say eighty-five, because i do not include corsica—you will not find, then, in these eighty-five departments a single hill on which there is not a telegraph, or a grotto in which the commissary of police has not put up a gaslamp.
Perplexity: 211345840.0000

Sentence: there is but one service i can render you, and for that i place myself entirely at your orders, that is, to present, or make my friends present, you everywhere; besides, you have no need of anyone to introduce you—with your name, and your fortune, and your talent” (monte cristo bowed with a somewhat ironical smile) “you can present yourself everywhere, and be well received.
Perplexity: 562460224.0000

Sentence: i can be useful in one way only—if knowledge of parisian habits, of the means of rendering yourself comfortable, or of the bazaars, can assist, you may depend upon me to find you a fitting dwelling here.
Perplexity: 38085680.0000

Sentence: i do not dare offer to share my apartments with you, as i shared yours at rome—i, who do not profess egotism, but am yet egotist _par excellence_; for, except myself, these rooms would not hold a shadow more, unless that shadow were feminine.” “ah,” said the count, “that is a most conjugal reservation; i recollect that at rome you said something of a projected marriage.
Perplexity: 2373015040.0000

Sentence: “no,” replied morcerf, “my father is most anxious about it; and i hope, ere long, to introduce you, if not to my wife, at least to my betrothed—mademoiselle eugénie danglars.” “eugénie danglars,” said monte cristo; “tell me, is not her father baron danglars?” “yes,” returned morcerf, “a baron of a new creation.” “what matter,” said monte cristo “if he has rendered the state services which merit this distinction?” “enormous ones,” answered beauchamp.
Perplexity: 33313526.0000

Sentence: “although in reality a liberal, he negotiated a loan of six millions for charles x., in 1829, who made him a baron and chevalier of the legion of honor; so that he wears the ribbon, not, as you would think, in his waistcoat-pocket, but at his button-hole.” “ah,” interrupted morcerf, laughing, “beauchamp, beauchamp, keep that for the _corsaire_ or the _charivari_, but spare my future father-in-law before me.” then, turning to monte cristo, “you just now spoke his name as if you knew the baron?” “i do not know him,” returned monte cristo; “but i shall probably soon make his acquaintance, for i have a credit opened with him by the house of richard & blount, of london, arstein & eskeles of vienna, and thomson & french at rome.” as he pronounced the two last names, the count glanced at maximilian morrel.
Perplexity: 355818688.0000

Sentence: if the stranger expected to produce an effect on morrel, he was not mistaken—maximilian started as if he had been electrified.

Perplexity: 326114912.0000

Sentence: château-renaud,” returned debray, “you only know your dull and gloomy faubourg saint-germain; do not pay any attention to him, count—live in the chaussée d’antin, that’s the real centre of paris.” “boulevard de l’opéra,” said beauchamp; “the second floor—a house with a balcony.
Perplexity: 68219200.0000

Sentence: the count will have his cushions of silver cloth brought there, and as he smokes his chibouque, see all paris pass before him.” “you have no idea, then, morrel?” asked château-renaud; “you do not propose anything.” “oh, yes,” returned the young man, smiling; “on the contrary, i have one, but i expected the count would be tempted by one of the brilliant proposals made him, yet as he has not replied to any of them, i will venture to offer him a suite of apartments in a charming hotel, in the pompadour style, that my sister has inhabited for a year, in the rue meslay.” “you have a sister?” asked the count.

Perplexity: 234538992.0000

Sentence: “take care, you are going to immure a traveller, sinbad the sailor, a man who comes to see paris; you are going to make a patriarch of him.” 20255m “oh, no,” said morrel; “my sister is five-and-twenty, my brother-in-law is thirty, they are gay, young, and happy.
Perplexity: 176999808.0000

Sentence: besides, the count will be in his own house, and only see them when he thinks fit to do so.” “thanks, monsieur,” said monte cristo; “i shall content myself with being presented to your sister and her husband, if you will do me the honor to introduce me; but i cannot accept the offer of anyone of these gentlemen, since my habitation is already prepared.” “what,” cried morcerf; “you are, then, going to a hotel—that will be very dull for you.” “was i so badly lodged at rome?” said monte cristo smiling.
Perplexity: 80492320.0000

Sentence: “_parbleu!_ at rome you spent fifty thousand piastres in furnishing your apartments, but i presume that you are not disposed to spend a similar sum every day.” “it is not that which deterred me,” replied monte cristo; “but as i determined to have a house to myself, i sent on my valet de chambre, and he ought by this time to have bought the house and furnished it.” “but you have, then, a valet de chambre who knows paris?” said beauchamp.
Perplexity: 260444672.0000

Perplexity: 702236992.0000

Sentence: but how could you charge a nubian to purchase a house, and a mute to furnish it?—he will do everything wrong.” “undeceive yourself, monsieur,” replied monte cristo; “i am quite sure, that, on the contrary, he will choose everything as i wish.

Perplexity: 4272253952.0000

Sentence: “no,” said monte cristo; “i told you i did not wish to be behind my time; i dressed myself in the carriage, and descended at the viscount’s door.” the young men looked at each other; they did not know if it was a comedy monte cristo was playing, but every word he uttered had such an air of simplicity, that it was impossible to suppose what he said was false—besides, why should he tell a falsehood?
Perplexity: 254772288.0000

Perplexity: 368473792.0000

Sentence: “of how much does he rob you every year?” “on my word,” replied the count, “not more than another.
Perplexity: 676515584.0000

Sentence: he thought of the fair greek he had seen in the count’s box at the argentina and valle theatres.

Sentence: “i have something better than that,” said monte cristo; “i have a slave.
Perplexity: 176172256.0000

Sentence: you procure your mistresses from the opera, the vaudeville, or the variétés; i purchased mine at constantinople; it cost me more, but i have nothing to fear.” “but you forget,” replied debray, laughing, “that we are franks by name and franks by nature, as king charles said, and that the moment she puts her foot in france your slave becomes free.” “who will tell her?” “the first person who sees her.” “she only speaks romaic.” “that is different.” “but at least we shall see her,” said beauchamp, “or do you keep eunuchs as well as mutes?” “oh, no,” replied monte cristo; “i do not carry brutalism so far.
Perplexity: 150716288.0000

Sentence: everyone who surrounds me is free to quit me, and when they leave me will no longer have any need of me or anyone else; it is for that reason, perhaps, that they do not quit me.” they had long since passed to dessert and cigars.

Perplexity: 753364416.0000

Sentence: they descended to the first floor; albert led his guest into the salon.
Perplexity: 368149248.0000

Sentence: the salon was filled with the works of modern artists; there were landscapes by dupré, with their long reeds and tall trees, their lowing oxen and marvellous skies; delacroix’s arabian cavaliers, with their long white burnouses, their shining belts, their damasked arms, their horses, who tore each other with their teeth while their riders contended fiercely with their maces; _aquarelles_ of boulanger, representing notre dame de paris with that vigor that makes the artist the rival of the poet; there were paintings by diaz, who makes his flowers more beautiful than flowers, his suns more brilliant than the sun; designs by decamp, as vividly colored as those of salvator rosa, but more poetic; _pastels_ by giraud and müller, representing children like angels and women with the features of a virgin; sketches torn from the album of dauzats’ “travels in the east,” that had been made in a few seconds on the saddle of a camel, or beneath the dome of a mosque—in a word, all that modern art can give in exchange and as recompense for the art lost and gone with ages long since past.
Perplexity: 228332416.0000

Sentence: albert expected to have something new this time to show to the traveller, but, to his great surprise, the latter, without seeking for the signatures, many of which, indeed, were only initials, named instantly the author of every picture in such a manner that it was easy to see that each name was not only known to him, but that each style associated with it had been appreciated and studied by him.

Perplexity: 1359670272.0000

Sentence: the countess had this portrait painted during the count’s absence.
Perplexity: 62308892.0000

Sentence: she doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise; but, strange to say, this portrait seemed to displease my father, and the value of the picture, which is, as you see, one of the best works of léopold robert, could not overcome his dislike to it.
Perplexity: 931758400.0000

Sentence: it is true, between ourselves, that m. de morcerf is one of the most assiduous peers at the luxembourg, a general renowned for theory, but a most mediocre amateur of art.
Perplexity: 181421664.0000

Sentence: this disagreement is the only one that has ever taken place between the count and countess, who are still as much united, although married more than twenty years, as on the first day of their wedding.” 20261m monte cristo glanced rapidly at albert, as if to seek a hidden meaning in his words, but it was evident the young man uttered them in the simplicity of his heart.

Perplexity: 953139648.0000

Sentence: however, accept what i propose to you as an initiation into parisian life—a life of politeness, visiting, and introductions.” monte cristo bowed without making any answer; he accepted the offer without enthusiasm and without regret, as one of those conventions of society which every gentleman looks upon as a duty.

Perplexity: 3939269632.0000

Sentence: except the knowledge of blazons, that enables me to decipher them, i am very ignorant of heraldry—i, a count of a fresh creation, fabricated in tuscany by the aid of a commandery of st. stephen, and who would not have taken the trouble had i not been told that when you travel much it is necessary.
Perplexity: 101288664.0000

Sentence: one of your ancestors had joined the crusades, and supposing it to be only that of st. louis, that makes you mount to the thirteenth century, which is tolerably ancient.” “it is possible,” said morcerf; “my father has in his study a genealogical tree which will tell you all that, and on which i made commentaries that would have greatly edified d’hozier and jaucourt.
Perplexity: 301443072.0000

Sentence: at present i no longer think of it, and yet i must tell you that we are beginning to occupy ourselves greatly with these things under our popular government.” “well, then, your government would do well to choose from the past something better than the things that i have noticed on your monuments, and which have no heraldic meaning whatever.
Perplexity: 1943455616.0000

Sentence: as for you, viscount,” continued monte cristo to morcerf, “you are more fortunate than the government, for your arms are really beautiful, and speak to the imagination.
Perplexity: 536825120.0000

Sentence: yes, you are at once from provence and spain; that explains, if the portrait you showed me be like, the dark hue i so much admired on the visage of the noble catalan.” it would have required the penetration of œdipus or the sphinx to have divined the irony the count concealed beneath these words, apparently uttered with the greatest politeness.
Perplexity: 66008292.0000

Perplexity: 261563296.0000

Sentence: monte cristo was engaged in examining this portrait with no less care than he had bestowed upon the other, when another door opened, and he found himself opposite to the count of morcerf in person.
Perplexity: 145382672.0000

Sentence: “father,” said the young man, “i have the honor of presenting to you the count of monte cristo, the generous friend whom i had the good fortune to meet in the critical situation of which i have told you.” “you are most welcome, monsieur,” said the count of morcerf, saluting monte cristo with a smile, “and monsieur has rendered our house, in preserving its only heir, a service which insures him our eternal gratitude.” as he said these words, the count of morcerf pointed to a chair, while he seated himself in another opposite the window.
Perplexity: 34952720.0000

Sentence: monte cristo, in taking the seat morcerf offered him, placed himself in such a manner as to remain concealed in the shadow of the large velvet curtains, and read on the careworn and livid features of the count a whole history of secret griefs written in each wrinkle time had planted there.

Sentence: “the countess,” said morcerf, “was at her toilet when she was informed of the visit she was about to receive.
Perplexity: 597390912.0000

Sentence: made a peer at the restoration, i served through the first campaign under the orders of marshal bourmont.
Perplexity: 257753360.0000

Perplexity: 416931520.0000

Perplexity: 116165688.0000

Sentence: i tendered my resignation, for when you have gained your epaulets on the battle-field, you do not know how to manœuvre on the slippery grounds of the salons.

Sentence: i have hung up my sword, and cast myself into politics.

Perplexity: 211474048.0000

Sentence: “a gentleman of high birth, possessor of an ample fortune, you have consented to gain your promotion as an obscure soldier, step by step—this is uncommon; then become general, peer of france, commander of the legion of honor, you consent to again commence a second apprenticeship, without any other hope or any other desire than that of one day becoming useful to your fellow-creatures; this, indeed, is praiseworthy,—nay, more, it is sublime.” 20265m albert looked on and listened with astonishment; he was not used to see monte cristo give vent to such bursts of enthusiasm.
Perplexity: 164894816.0000

Sentence: “alas,” continued the stranger, doubtless to dispel the slight cloud that covered morcerf’s brow, “we do not act thus in italy; we grow according to our race and our species, and we pursue the same lines, and often the same uselessness, all our lives.” “but, monsieur,” said the count of morcerf, “for a man of your merit, italy is not a country, and france opens her arms to receive you; respond to her call.
Perplexity: 25698448.0000

Sentence: france will not, perhaps, be always ungrateful.
Perplexity: 55695776.0000

Sentence: she treats her children ill, but she always welcomes strangers.” “ah, father,” said albert with a smile, “it is evident you do not know the count of monte cristo; he despises all honors, and contents himself with those written on his passport.” “that is the most just remark,” replied the stranger, “i ever heard made concerning myself.” “you have been free to choose your career,” observed the count of morcerf, with a sigh; “and you have chosen the path strewed with flowers.” “precisely, monsieur,” replied monte cristo with one of those smiles that a painter could never represent or a physiologist analyze.
Perplexity: 118902096.0000

Sentence: “if i did not fear to fatigue you,” said the general, evidently charmed with the count’s manners, “i would have taken you to the chamber; there is a debate very curious to those who are strangers to our modern senators.” “i shall be most grateful, monsieur, if you will, at some future time, renew your offer, but i have been flattered with the hope of being introduced to the countess, and i will therefore wait.” “ah, here is my mother,” cried the viscount.
Perplexity: 1748917376.0000

Sentence: monte cristo, turned round hastily, and saw madame de morcerf at the entrance of the salon, at the door opposite to that by which her husband had entered, pale and motionless; when monte cristo turned round, she let fall her arm, which for some unknown reason had been resting on the gilded door-post.

Perplexity: 180486336.0000

Sentence: now, i thank you for the pleasure you give me in thus affording me the opportunity of thanking you as i have blessed you, from the bottom of my heart.” the count bowed again, but lower than before; he was even paler than mercédès.
Perplexity: 198049344.0000

Sentence: “madame,” said he, “the count and yourself recompense too generously a simple action.
Perplexity: 180638560.0000

Sentence: to save a man, to spare a father’s feelings, or a mother’s sensibility, is not to do a good action, but a simple deed of humanity.” at these words, uttered with the most exquisite sweetness and politeness, madame de morcerf replied: “it is very fortunate for my son, monsieur, that he found such a friend, and i thank god that things are thus.” and mercédès raised her fine eyes to heaven with so fervent an expression of gratitude, that the count fancied he saw tears in them.
Perplexity: 126913904.0000

Sentence: m. de morcerf approached her.

Perplexity: 315439968.0000

Sentence: “monsieur,” continued she, turning to monte cristo, “will you do us the honor of passing the rest of the day with us?” “believe me, madame, i feel most grateful for your kindness, but i got out of my travelling carriage at your door this morning, and i am ignorant how i am installed in paris, which i scarcely know; this is but a trifling inquietude, i know, but one that may be appreciated.” “we shall have the pleasure another time,” said the countess; “you promise that?” monte cristo inclined himself without answering, but the gesture might pass for assent.
Perplexity: 102990536.0000

Sentence: “i will not detain you, monsieur,” continued the countess; “i would not have our gratitude become indiscreet or importunate.” “my dear count,” said albert, “i will endeavor to return your politeness at rome, and place my coupé at your disposal until your own be ready.” “a thousand thanks for your kindness, viscount,” returned the count of monte cristo “but i suppose that m. bertuccio has suitably employed the four hours and a half i have given him, and that i shall find a carriage of some sort ready at the door.” albert was used to the count’s manner of proceeding; he knew that, like nero, he was in search of the impossible, and nothing astonished him, but wishing to judge with his own eyes how far the count’s orders had been executed, he accompanied him to the door of the house.
Perplexity: 84046080.0000

Sentence: monte cristo was not deceived.
Perplexity: 305270496.0000

Perplexity: 270680192.0000

Sentence: “monsieur,” said the count to albert, “i do not ask you to accompany me to my house, as i can only show you a habitation fitted up in a hurry, and i have, as you know, a reputation to keep up as regards not being taken by surprise.
Perplexity: 606534592.0000

Sentence: give me, therefore, one more day before i invite you; i shall then be certain not to fail in my hospitality.” “if you ask me for a day, count, i know what to anticipate; it will not be a house i shall see, but a palace.
Perplexity: 768887296.0000

Sentence: you have decidedly some genius at your control.” “_ma foi_, spread that idea,” replied the count of monte cristo, putting his foot on the velvet-lined steps of his splendid carriage, “and that will be worth something to me among the ladies.” as he spoke, he sprang into the vehicle, the door was closed, but not so rapidly that monte cristo failed to perceive the almost imperceptible movement which stirred the curtains of the apartment in which he had left madame de morcerf.
Perplexity: 2305811968.0000

Sentence: when albert returned to his mother, he found her in the boudoir reclining in a large velvet armchair, the whole room so obscure that only the shining spangle, fastened here and there to the drapery, and the angles of the gilded frames of the pictures, showed with some degree of brightness in the gloom.
Perplexity: 185011536.0000

Sentence: he could distinguish amid the perfumes of the roses and heliotropes in the flower-stands, the sharp and fragrant odor of volatile salts, and he noticed in one of the chased cups on the mantle-piece the countess’s smelling-bottle, taken from its shagreen case, and exclaimed in a tone of uneasiness, as he entered: “my dear mother, have you been ill during my absence?” “no, no, albert, but you know these roses, tuberoses, and orange-flowers throw out at first, before one is used to them, such violent perfumes.” “then, my dear mother,” said albert, putting his hand to the bell, “they must be taken into the antechamber.
Perplexity: 50153576.0000

Sentence: you are really ill, and just now were so pale as you came into the room——” “was i pale, albert?” “yes; a pallor that suits you admirably, mother, but which did not the less alarm my father and myself.” “did your father speak of it?” inquired mercédès eagerly.
Perplexity: 145706368.0000

Perplexity: 221015024.0000

Sentence: “you have seen, my dear albert—i ask the question as a mother—you have seen m. de monte cristo in his house, you are quicksighted, have much knowledge of the world, more tact than is usual at your age, do you think the count is really what he appears to be?” “what does he appear to be?” “why, you have just said,—a man of high distinction.” “i told you, my dear mother, he was esteemed such.” “but what is your own opinion, albert?” “i must tell you that i have not come to any decided opinion respecting him, but i think him a maltese.” “i do not ask you of his origin but what he is.” “ah!

Sentence: i have seen so many remarkable things in him, that if you would have me really say what i think, i shall reply that i really do look upon him as one of byron’s heroes, whom misery has marked with a fatal brand; some manfred, some lara, some werner, one of those wrecks, as it were, of some ancient family, who, disinherited of their patrimony, have achieved one by the force of their adventurous genius, which has placed them above the laws of society.” “you say——” “i say that monte cristo is an island in the midst of the mediterranean, without inhabitants or garrison, the resort of smugglers of all nations, and pirates of every flag.

Sentence: now, leave me, and desire my valet de chambre to come hither.” scarcely had ali disappeared when the valet entered the chamber.
Perplexity: 93460928.0000

Sentence: “monsieur baptistin,” said the count, “you have been in my service one year, the time i generally give myself to judge of the merits or demerits of those about me.
Perplexity: 1128499072.0000

Sentence: you suit me very well.” baptistin bowed low.
Perplexity: 439011328.0000

Sentence: “it only remains for me to know whether i also suit you?” “oh, your excellency!” exclaimed baptistin eagerly.
Perplexity: 370396064.0000

Sentence: “listen, if you please, till i have finished speaking,” replied monte cristo.
Perplexity: 33513642.0000

Sentence: “you receive 1,500 francs per annum for your services here—more than many a brave subaltern, who continually risks his life for his country, obtains.
Perplexity: 358878336.0000

Sentence: you live in a manner far superior to many clerks who work ten times harder than you do for their money.
Perplexity: 121262272.0000

Sentence: then, though yourself a servant, you have other servants to wait upon you, take care of your clothes, and see that your linen is duly prepared for you.
Perplexity: 316293088.0000

Sentence: again, you make a profit upon each article you purchase for my toilet, amounting in the course of a year to a sum equalling your wages.” “nay, indeed, your excellency.” “i am not condemning you for this, monsieur baptistin; but let your profits end here.
Perplexity: 325866176.0000

Sentence: it would be long indeed ere you would find so lucrative a post as that you have now the good fortune to fill.
Perplexity: 29099892.0000

Sentence: i neither ill-use nor ill-treat my servants by word or action.
Perplexity: 46263604.0000

Sentence: an error i readily forgive, but wilful negligence or forgetfulness, never.
Perplexity: 579496128.0000

Sentence: my commands are ordinarily short, clear, and precise; and i would rather be obliged to repeat my words twice, or even three times, than they should be misunderstood.
Perplexity: 867378560.0000

Sentence: i am rich enough to know whatever i desire to know, and i can promise you i am not wanting in curiosity.
Perplexity: 793114304.0000

Sentence: if, then, i should learn that you had taken upon yourself to speak of me to anyone favorably or unfavorably, to comment on my actions, or watch my conduct, that very instant you would quit my service.
Perplexity: 840499648.0000

Sentence: you may now retire.
Perplexity: 335332256.0000

Sentence: i never caution my servants a second time—remember that.” baptistin bowed, and was proceeding towards the door.
Perplexity: 1266675328.0000

Sentence: “i forgot to mention to you,” said the count, “that i lay yearly aside a certain sum for each servant in my establishment; those whom i am compelled to dismiss lose (as a matter of course) all participation in this money, while their portion goes to the fund accumulating for those domestics who remain with me, and among whom it will be divided at my death.
Perplexity: 261436112.0000

Sentence: you have been in my service a year, your fund has already begun to accumulate—let it continue to do so.” this address, delivered in the presence of ali, who, not understanding one word of the language in which it was spoken, stood wholly unmoved, produced an effect on m. baptistin only to be conceived by such as have occasion to study the character and disposition of french domestics.
Perplexity: 20168857600.0000

Sentence: “i assure your excellency,” said he, “that at least it shall be my study to merit your approbation in all things, and i will take m. ali as my model.” “by no means,” replied the count in the most frigid tones; “ali has many faults mixed with most excellent qualities.
Perplexity: 130916104.0000

Sentence: he cannot possibly serve you as a pattern for your conduct, not being, as you are, a paid servant, but a mere slave—a dog, who, should he fail in his duty towards me, i should not discharge from my service, but kill.” baptistin opened his eyes with astonishment.
Perplexity: 98555824.0000

Sentence: “you seem incredulous,” said monte cristo, who repeated to ali in the arabic language what he had just been saying to baptistin in french.
Perplexity: 158723952.0000

Sentence: the nubian smiled assentingly to his master’s words, then, kneeling on one knee, respectfully kissed the hand of the count.
Perplexity: 112839304.0000

Sentence: this corroboration of the lesson he had just received put the finishing stroke to the wonder and stupefaction of m. baptistin.
Perplexity: 63319216.0000

Sentence: the count then motioned the valet de chambre to retire, and to ali to follow to his study, where they conversed long and earnestly together.
Perplexity: 1000332736.0000

Sentence: as the hand of the clock pointed to five the count struck thrice upon his gong.
Perplexity: 112551704.0000

Sentence: when ali was wanted one stroke was given, two summoned baptistin, and three bertuccio.
Perplexity: 326794848.0000

Sentence: the steward entered.
Perplexity: 1181387520.0000

Sentence: “my horses,” said monte cristo.
Perplexity: 988684160.0000

Sentence: “they are at the door harnessed to the carriage as your excellency desired.
Perplexity: 124100752.0000

Sentence: does your excellency wish me to accompany him?” “no, the coachman, ali, and baptistin will go.” the count descended to the door of his mansion, and beheld his carriage drawn by the very pair of horses he had so much admired in the morning as the property of danglars.
Perplexity: 236518736.0000

Sentence: as he passed them he said: “they are extremely handsome certainly, and you have done well to purchase them, although you were somewhat remiss not to have procured them sooner.” “indeed, your excellency, i had very considerable difficulty in obtaining them, and, as it is, they have cost an enormous price.” “does the sum you gave for them make the animals less beautiful,” inquired the count, shrugging his shoulders.
Perplexity: 532052480.0000

Sentence: “nay, if your excellency is satisfied, it is all that i could wish.
Perplexity: 570223552.0000

Sentence: whither does your excellency desire to be driven?” “to the residence of baron danglars, rue de la chaussée d’antin.” this conversation had passed as they stood upon the terrace, from which a flight of stone steps led to the carriage-drive.
Perplexity: 121624080.0000

Sentence: as bertuccio, with a respectful bow, was moving away, the count called him back.
Perplexity: 125901272.0000

Sentence: “i have another commission for you, m. bertuccio,” said he; “i am desirous of having an estate by the seaside in normandy—for instance, between le havre and boulogne.
Perplexity: 45347500.0000

Sentence: you see i give you a wide range.
Perplexity: 181511664.0000

Sentence: it will be absolutely necessary that the place you may select have a small harbor, creek, or bay, into which my corvette can enter and remain at anchor.
Perplexity: 648052352.0000

Sentence: she draws only fifteen feet.
Perplexity: 85621888.0000

Sentence: she must be kept in constant readiness to sail immediately i think proper to give the signal.
Perplexity: 393850144.0000

Sentence: make the requisite inquiries for a place of this description, and when you have met with an eligible spot, visit it, and if it possess the advantages desired, purchase it at once in your own name.
Perplexity: 173421120.0000

Sentence: the corvette must now, i think, be on her way to fécamp, must she not?” 20333m “certainly, your excellency; i saw her put to sea the same evening we quitted marseilles.” “and the yacht.” “was ordered to remain at martigues.” “’tis well.
Perplexity: 351437920.0000

Sentence: i wish you to write from time to time to the captains in charge of the two vessels so as to keep them on the alert.” “and the steamboat?” “she is at châlons?” “yes.” “the same orders for her as for the two sailing vessels.” “very good.” “when you have purchased the estate i desire, i want constant relays of horses at ten leagues apart along the northern and southern road.” “your excellency may depend upon me.” the count made a gesture of satisfaction, descended the terrace steps, and sprang into his carriage, which was whirled along swiftly to the banker’s house.
Perplexity: 4511616512.0000

Sentence: danglars was engaged at that moment, presiding over a railroad committee.
Perplexity: 198922736.0000

Sentence: but the meeting was nearly concluded when the name of his visitor was announced.
Perplexity: 167374640.0000

Sentence: as the count’s title sounded on his ear he rose, and addressing his colleagues, who were members of one or the other chamber, he said: “gentlemen, pardon me for leaving you so abruptly; but a most ridiculous circumstance has occurred, which is this,—thomson & french, the roman bankers, have sent to me a certain person calling himself the count of monte cristo, and have given him an unlimited credit with me.
Perplexity: 29393870.0000

Sentence: i confess this is the drollest thing i have ever met with in the course of my extensive foreign transactions, and you may readily suppose it has greatly roused my curiosity.
Perplexity: 35810684.0000

Sentence: i took the trouble this morning to call on the pretended count—if he were a real count he wouldn’t be so rich.
Perplexity: 938957056.0000

Sentence: but, would you believe it, ‘he was not receiving.’ so the master of monte cristo gives himself airs befitting a great millionaire or a capricious beauty.
Perplexity: 185749120.0000

Sentence: i made inquiries, and found that the house in the champs-élysées is his own property, and certainly it was very decently kept up.
Perplexity: 341246976.0000

Sentence: but,” pursued danglars with one of his sinister smiles, “an order for unlimited credit calls for something like caution on the part of the banker to whom that order is given.
Perplexity: 55709908.0000

Sentence: i am very anxious to see this man.
Perplexity: 286005984.0000

Sentence: i suspect a hoax is intended, but the instigators of it little knew whom they had to deal with.
Perplexity: 12243558400.0000

Sentence: ‘they laugh best who laugh last!’” having delivered himself of this pompous address, uttered with a degree of energy that left the baron almost out of breath, he bowed to the assembled party and withdrew to his drawing-room, whose sumptuous furnishings of white and gold had caused a great sensation in the chaussée d’antin.
Perplexity: 255537328.0000

Sentence: it was to this apartment he had desired his guest to be shown, with the purpose of overwhelming him at the sight of so much luxury.
Perplexity: 16136978432.0000

Sentence: he found the count standing before some copies of albano and fattore that had been passed off to the banker as originals; but which, mere copies as they were, seemed to feel their degradation in being brought into juxtaposition with the gaudy colors that covered the ceiling.
Perplexity: 923421824.0000

Sentence: the count turned round as he heard the entrance of danglars into the room.
Perplexity: 151553984.0000

Sentence: with a slight inclination of the head, danglars signed to the count to be seated, pointing significantly to a gilded armchair, covered with white satin embroidered with gold.
Perplexity: 1903533440.0000

Sentence: the count sat down.
Perplexity: 739883072.0000

Sentence: 20335m “i have the honor, i presume, of addressing m. de monte cristo.” the count bowed.
Perplexity: 42791004.0000

Sentence: “and i of speaking to baron danglars, chevalier of the legion of honor, and member of the chamber of deputies?” monte cristo repeated all the titles he had read on the baron’s card.
Perplexity: 34725856.0000

Sentence: danglars felt the irony and compressed his lips.
Perplexity: 1226320768.0000

Sentence: “you will, i trust, excuse me, monsieur, for not calling you by your title when i first addressed you,” he said, “but you are aware that we are living under a popular form of government, and that i am myself a representative of the liberties of the people.” “so much so,” replied monte cristo, “that while you call yourself baron you are not willing to call anybody else count.” “upon my word, monsieur,” said danglars with affected carelessness, “i attach no sort of value to such empty distinctions; but the fact is, i was made baron, and also chevalier of the legion of honor, in return for services rendered, but——” “but you have discarded your titles after the example set you by messrs. de montmorency and lafayette?
Perplexity: 83455512.0000

Sentence: that was a noble example to follow, monsieur.” “why,” replied danglars, “not entirely so; with the servants,—you understand.” “i see; to your domestics you are ‘my lord,’ the journalists style you ‘monsieur,’ while your constituents call you ‘citizen.’ these are distinctions very suitable under a constitutional government.
Perplexity: 81774712.0000

Sentence: i understand perfectly.” again danglars bit his lips; he saw that he was no match for monte cristo in an argument of this sort, and he therefore hastened to turn to subjects more congenial.
Perplexity: 75541016.0000

Sentence: “permit me to inform you, count,” said he, bowing, “that i have received a letter of advice from thomson & french, of rome.” “i am glad to hear it, baron,—for i must claim the privilege of addressing you after the manner of your servants.
Perplexity: 147696336.0000

Sentence: i have acquired the bad habit of calling persons by their titles from living in a country where barons are still barons by right of birth.
Perplexity: 342863680.0000

Sentence: but as regards the letter of advice, i am charmed to find that it has reached you; that will spare me the troublesome and disagreeable task of coming to you for money myself.
Perplexity: 2031784704.0000

Sentence: you have received a regular letter of advice?” “yes,” said danglars, “but i confess i didn’t quite comprehend its meaning.” “indeed?” “and for that reason i did myself the honor of calling upon you, in order to beg for an explanation.” “go on, monsieur.
Perplexity: 466781728.0000

Sentence: here i am, ready to give you any explanation you desire.” “why,” said danglars, “in the letter—i believe i have it about me”—here he felt in his breast-pocket—“yes, here it is.
Perplexity: 160556352.0000

Sentence: well, this letter gives the count of monte cristo unlimited credit on our house.” “well, baron, what is there difficult to understand about that?” “merely the term _unlimited_—nothing else, certainly.” “is not that word known in france?
Perplexity: 557356544.0000

Sentence: the people who wrote are anglo-germans, you know.” “oh, as for the composition of the letter, there is nothing to be said; but as regards the competency of the document, i certainly have doubts.” “is it possible?” asked the count, assuming all air and tone of the utmost simplicity and candor.
Perplexity: 47835980.0000

Sentence: “is it possible that thomson & french are not looked upon as safe and solvent bankers?
Perplexity: 203660256.0000

Sentence: pray tell me what you think, baron, for i feel uneasy, i can assure you, having some considerable property in their hands.” “thomson & french are perfectly solvent,” replied danglars, with an almost mocking smile; “but the word _unlimited_, in financial affairs, is so extremely vague.” “is, in fact, unlimited,” said monte cristo.
Perplexity: 1106026240.0000

Sentence: “precisely what i was about to say,” cried danglars.
Perplexity: 65444412.0000

Sentence: “now what is vague is doubtful; and it was a wise man who said, ‘when in doubt, keep out.’” “meaning to say,” rejoined monte cristo, “that however thomson & french may be inclined to commit acts of imprudence and folly, the baron danglars is not disposed to follow their example.” “not at all.” “plainly enough; messrs. thomson & french set no bounds to their engagements while those of m. danglars have their limits; he is a wise man, according to his own showing.” “monsieur,” replied the banker, drawing himself up with a haughty air, “the extent of my resources has never yet been questioned.” “it seems, then, reserved for me,” said monte cristo coldly, “to be the first to do so.” “by what right, sir?” “by right of the objections you have raised, and the explanations you have demanded, which certainly must have some motive.” once more danglars bit his lips.
Perplexity: 65368192.0000

Sentence: it was the second time he had been worsted, and this time on his own ground.
Perplexity: 174355072.0000

Sentence: his forced politeness sat awkwardly upon him, and approached almost to impertinence.
Perplexity: 117327832.0000

Sentence: monte cristo on the contrary, preserved a graceful suavity of demeanor, aided by a certain degree of simplicity he could assume at pleasure, and thus possessed the advantage.
Perplexity: 96002680.0000

Sentence: “well, sir,” resumed danglars, after a brief silence, “i will endeavor to make myself understood, by requesting you to inform me for what sum you propose to draw upon me?” “why, truly,” replied monte cristo, determined not to lose an inch of the ground he had gained, “my reason for desiring an ‘unlimited’ credit was precisely because i did not know how much money i might need.” the banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper hand.
Perplexity: 60786152.0000

Sentence: so throwing himself back in his armchair, he said, with an arrogant and purse-proud air: “let me beg of you not to hesitate in naming your wishes; you will then be convinced that the resources of the house of danglars, however limited, are still equal to meeting the largest demands; and were you even to require a million——” “i beg your pardon,” interposed monte cristo.
Perplexity: 64919524.0000

Sentence: “i said a million,” replied danglars, with the confidence of ignorance.
Perplexity: 2234622208.0000

Sentence: “but could i do with a million?” retorted the count.
Perplexity: 460051904.0000

Sentence: “my dear sir, if a trifle like that could suffice me, i should never have given myself the trouble of opening an account.
Perplexity: 66868724.0000

Sentence: a million?
Perplexity: 53024288.0000

Sentence: excuse my smiling when you speak of a sum i am in the habit of carrying in my pocket-book or dressing-case.” and with these words monte cristo took from his pocket a small case containing his visiting-cards, and drew forth two orders on the treasury for 500,000 francs each, payable at sight to the bearer.
Perplexity: 1071539520.0000

Sentence: a man like danglars was wholly inaccessible to any gentler method of correction.
Perplexity: 326144128.0000

Sentence: the effect of the present revelation was stunning; he trembled and was on the verge of apoplexy.
Perplexity: 173140512.0000

Sentence: the pupils of his eyes, as he gazed at monte cristo dilated horribly.
Perplexity: 2978829824.0000

Sentence: “come, come,” said monte cristo, “confess honestly that you have not perfect confidence in thomson & french.
Perplexity: 215895648.0000

Sentence: i understand, and foreseeing that such might be the case, i took, in spite of my ignorance of affairs, certain precautions.
Perplexity: 24891262.0000

Sentence: see, here are two similar letters to that you have yourself received; one from the house of arstein & eskeles of vienna, to baron rothschild, the other drawn by baring of london, upon m. lafitte.
Perplexity: 87985168.0000

Sentence: now, sir, you have but to say the word, and i will spare you all uneasiness by presenting my letter of credit to one or other of these two firms.” the blow had struck home, and danglars was entirely vanquished; with a trembling hand he took the two letters from the count, who held them carelessly between finger and thumb, and proceeded to scrutinize the signatures, with a minuteness that the count might have regarded as insulting, had it not suited his present purpose to mislead the banker.
Perplexity: 1110505472.0000

Sentence: “oh, sir,” said danglars, after he had convinced himself of the authenticity of the documents he held, and rising as if to salute the power of gold personified in the man before him,—“three letters of unlimited credit!
Perplexity: 49441892.0000

Sentence: i can be no longer mistrustful, but you must pardon me, my dear count, for confessing to some degree of astonishment.” “nay,” answered monte cristo, with the most gentlemanly air, “’tis not for such trifling sums as these that your banking house is to be incommoded.
Perplexity: 97075432.0000

Sentence: then, you can let me have some money, can you not?” “whatever you say, my dear count; i am at your orders.” “why,” replied monte cristo, “since we mutually understand each other—for such i presume is the case?” danglars bowed assentingly.
Perplexity: 532052480.0000

Sentence: “you are quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your mind?” “oh, my dear count,” exclaimed danglars, “i never for an instant entertained such a feeling towards you.” “no, you merely wished to be convinced, nothing more; but now that we have come to so clear an understanding, and that all distrust and suspicion are laid at rest, we may as well fix a sum as the probable expenditure of the first year, suppose we say six millions to——” “six millions!” gasped danglars—“so be it.” “then, if i should require more,” continued monte cristo in a careless manner, “why, of course, i should draw upon you; but my present intention is not to remain in france more than a year, and during that period i scarcely think i shall exceed the sum i mentioned.
Perplexity: 570223552.0000

Sentence: however, we shall see.
Perplexity: 577462592.0000

Sentence: be kind enough, then, to send me 500,000 francs tomorrow.
Perplexity: 108712480.0000

Sentence: i shall be at home till midday, or if not, i will leave a receipt with my steward.” “the money you desire shall be at your house by ten o’clock tomorrow morning, my dear count,” replied danglars.
Perplexity: 73004064.0000

Sentence: “how would you like to have it?
Perplexity: 51070148.0000

Sentence: in gold, silver, or notes?” “half in gold, and the other half in bank-notes, if you please,” said the count, rising from his seat.
Perplexity: 652893504.0000

Sentence: “i must confess to you, count,” said danglars, “that i have hitherto imagined myself acquainted with the degree of all the great fortunes of europe, and still wealth such as yours has been wholly unknown to me.
Perplexity: 205821728.0000

Sentence: may i presume to ask whether you have long possessed it?” “it has been in the family a very long while,” returned monte cristo, “a sort of treasure expressly forbidden to be touched for a certain period of years, during which the accumulated interest has doubled the capital.
Perplexity: 29834031104.0000

Sentence: the period appointed by the testator for the disposal of these riches occurred only a short time ago, and they have only been employed by me within the last few years.
Perplexity: 1058147136.0000

Sentence: your ignorance on the subject, therefore, is easily accounted for.
Perplexity: 635188288.0000

Sentence: however, you will be better informed as to me and my possessions ere long.” and the count, while pronouncing these latter words, accompanied them with one of those ghastly smiles that used to strike terror into poor franz d’épinay.
Perplexity: 451458400.0000

Sentence: “with your tastes, and means of gratifying them,” continued danglars, “you will exhibit a splendor that must effectually put us poor miserable millionaires quite in the shade.
Perplexity: 15512359936.0000

Sentence: if i mistake not you are an admirer of paintings, at least i judged so from the attention you appeared to be bestowing on mine when i entered the room.
Perplexity: 633031808.0000

Sentence: if you will permit me, i shall be happy to show you my picture gallery, composed entirely of works by the ancient masters—warranted as such.
Perplexity: 1610698880.0000

Sentence: not a modern picture among them.
Perplexity: 325325280.0000

Sentence: i cannot endure the modern school of painting.” “you are perfectly right in objecting to them, for this one great fault—that they have not yet had time to become old.” “or will you allow me to show you several fine statues by thorwaldsen, bartoloni, and canova?—all foreign artists, for, as you may perceive, i think but very indifferently of our french sculptors.” “you have a right to be unjust to them, monsieur; they are your compatriots.” “but all this may come later, when we shall be better known to each other.
Perplexity: 166881504.0000

Sentence: for the present, i will confine myself (if perfectly agreeable to you) to introducing you to the baroness danglars—excuse my impatience, my dear count, but a client like you is almost like a member of the family.” monte cristo bowed, in sign that he accepted the proffered honor; danglars rang and was answered by a servant in a showy livery.
Perplexity: 254730992.0000

Sentence: “is the baroness at home?” inquired danglars.
Perplexity: 133869192.0000

Sentence: “yes, my lord,” answered the man.
Perplexity: 59894796.0000

Sentence: “and alone?” “no, my lord, madame has visitors.” “have you any objection to meet any persons who may be with madame, or do you desire to preserve a strict _incognito_?” “no, indeed,” replied monte cristo with a smile, “i do not arrogate to myself the right of so doing.” “and who is with madame?—m.
Perplexity: 450200352.0000

Sentence: debray?” inquired danglars, with an air of indulgence and good-nature that made monte cristo smile, acquainted as he was with the secrets of the banker’s domestic life.
Perplexity: 174688272.0000

Sentence: “yes, my lord,” replied the servant, “m.
Perplexity: 174038768.0000

Sentence: debray is with madame.” danglars nodded his head; then, turning to monte cristo, said, “m.
Perplexity: 383178464.0000

Sentence: lucien debray is an old friend of ours, and private secretary to the minister of the interior.
Perplexity: 691186304.0000

Sentence: as for my wife, i must tell you, she lowered herself by marrying me, for she belongs to one of the most ancient families in france.
Perplexity: 424982048.0000

Sentence: her maiden name was de servières, and her first husband was colonel the marquis of nargonne.” “i have not the honor of knowing madame danglars; but i have already met m. lucien debray.” “ah, indeed?” said danglars; “and where was that?” “at the house of m. de morcerf.” “ah!
Perplexity: 345343904.0000

Sentence: you are acquainted with the young viscount, are you?” “we were together a good deal during the carnival at rome.” “true, true,” cried danglars.
Perplexity: 211334560.0000

Sentence: “let me see; have i not heard talk of some strange adventure with bandits or thieves hid in ruins, and of his having had a miraculous escape?

Perplexity: 253481520.0000

Sentence: the dappled grays the baron, followed by the count, traversed a long series of apartments, in which the prevailing characteristics were heavy magnificence and the gaudiness of ostentatious wealth, until he reached the boudoir of madame danglars—a small octagonal-shaped room, hung with pink satin, covered with white indian muslin.
Perplexity: 619353280.0000

Sentence: the chairs were of ancient workmanship and materials; over the doors were painted sketches of shepherds and shepherdesses, after the style and manner of boucher; and at each side pretty medallions in crayons, harmonizing well with the furnishings of this charming apartment, the only one throughout the great mansion in which any distinctive taste prevailed.
Perplexity: 18878538.0000

Sentence: the truth was, it had been entirely overlooked in the plan arranged and followed out by m. danglars and his architect, who had been selected to aid the baron in the great work of improvement solely because he was the most fashionable and celebrated decorator of the day.

Sentence: the decorations of the boudoir had then been left entirely to madame danglars and lucien debray.
Perplexity: 181505072.0000

Sentence: m. danglars, however, while possessing a great admiration for the antique, as it was understood during the time of the directory, entertained the most sovereign contempt for the simple elegance of his wife’s favorite sitting-room, where, by the way, he was never permitted to intrude, unless, indeed, he excused his own appearance by ushering in some more agreeable visitor than himself; and even then he had rather the air and manner of a person who was himself introduced, than that of being the presenter of another, his reception being cordial or frigid, in proportion as the person who accompanied him chanced to please or displease the baroness.
Perplexity: 114458976.0000

Sentence: lucien had found time, preparatory to the count’s arrival, to relate many particulars respecting him to madame danglars.
Perplexity: 171254304.0000

Sentence: it will be remembered that monte cristo had made a lively impression on the minds of all the party assembled at the breakfast given by albert de morcerf; and although debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings, he had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the impressive look and manner of the count, consequently the description given by lucien to the baroness bore the highly-colored tinge of his own heated imagination.
Perplexity: 1045516096.0000

Sentence: already excited by the wonderful stories related of the count by de morcerf, it is no wonder that madame danglars eagerly listened to, and fully credited, all the additional circumstances detailed by debray.

Perplexity: 923326656.0000

Sentence: that means balls, dinners, and lawn parties without end, in all of which i trust the count will remember us, as he may depend upon it we shall him, in our own humble entertainments.” in spite of the gross flattery and coarseness of this address, madame danglars could not forbear gazing with considerable interest on a man capable of expending six millions in twelve months, and who had selected paris for the scene of his princely extravagance.
Perplexity: 4168013312.0000

Sentence: “and when did you arrive here?” inquired she.
Perplexity: 806166720.0000

Sentence: do you propose entering any horses at either of these races, count?” “i shall do whatever they do at paris, madame, if i have the good fortune to find someone who will initiate me into the prevalent ideas of amusement.” “are you fond of horses, count?” “i have passed a considerable part of my life in the east, madame, and you are doubtless aware that the orientals value only two things—the fine breeding of their horses and the beauty of their women.” “nay, count,” said the baroness, “it would have been somewhat more gallant to have placed the ladies first.” “you see, madame, how rightly i spoke when i said i required a preceptor to guide me in all my sayings and doings here.” at this instant the favorite attendant of madame danglars entered the boudoir; approaching her mistress, she spoke some words in an undertone.
Perplexity: 10879971328.0000

Sentence: madame danglars turned very pale, then exclaimed: “i cannot believe it; the thing is impossible.” “i assure you, madame,” replied the woman, “it is as i have said.” turning impatiently towards her husband, madame danglars demanded, “is this true?” “is what true, madame?” inquired danglars, visibly agitated.
Perplexity: 352543648.0000

Sentence: “what my maid tells me.” “but what does she tell you?” “that when my coachman was about to harness the horses to my carriage, he discovered that they had been removed from the stables without his knowledge.
Perplexity: 360534528.0000

Sentence: i desire to know what is the meaning of this?” “be kind enough, madame, to listen to me,” said danglars.

Perplexity: 1115034752.0000

Perplexity: 65644316.0000

Sentence: but to you, at least, m. debray, i need not give a further description, because to you my beautiful pair of dappled grays were well known.
Perplexity: 1048655680.0000

Sentence: well, i had promised madame de villefort the loan of my carriage to drive tomorrow to the bois; but when my coachman goes to fetch the grays from the stables they are gone—positively gone.
Perplexity: 106335024.0000

Sentence: no doubt m. danglars has sacrificed them to the selfish consideration of gaining some thousands of paltry francs.
Perplexity: 57106352.0000

Sentence: oh, what a detestable crew they are, these mercenary speculators!” “madame,” replied danglars, “the horses were not sufficiently quiet for you; they were scarcely four years old, and they made me extremely uneasy on your account.” “nonsense,” retorted the baroness; “you could not have entertained any alarm on the subject, because you are perfectly well aware that i have had for a month in my service the very best coachman in paris.
Perplexity: 1796018048.0000

Sentence: but, perhaps, you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses?” “my dear love, pray do not say any more about them, and i promise you another pair exactly like them in appearance, only more quiet and steady.” the baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable contempt, while her husband, affecting not to observe this unconjugal gesture, turned towards monte cristo and said,—“upon my word, count, i am quite sorry not to have met you sooner.
Perplexity: 28695880.0000

Sentence: you are setting up an establishment, of course?” “why, yes,” replied the count.

Sentence: there they are.
Perplexity: 133881448.0000

Perplexity: 29122869248.0000

Perplexity: 333611072.0000

Sentence: poor danglars looked so crest-fallen and discomfited that monte cristo assumed a pitying air towards him.
Perplexity: 956313728.0000

Sentence: “see,” said the count, “how very ungrateful women are.
Perplexity: 180488400.0000

Perplexity: 2343405568.0000

Sentence: but so it is; a woman will often, from mere wilfulness, prefer that which is dangerous to that which is safe.
Perplexity: 318149984.0000

Sentence: therefore, in my opinion, my dear baron, the best and easiest way is to leave them to their fancies, and allow them to act as they please, and then, if any mischief follows, why, at least, they have no one to blame but themselves.” danglars made no reply; he was occupied in anticipations of the coming scene between himself and the baroness, whose frowning brow, like that of olympic jove, predicted a storm.
Perplexity: 176734320.0000

Sentence: debray, who perceived the gathering clouds, and felt no desire to witness the explosion of madame danglars’ rage, suddenly recollected an appointment, which compelled him to take his leave; while monte cristo, unwilling by prolonging his stay to destroy the advantages he hoped to obtain, made a farewell bow and departed, leaving danglars to endure the angry reproaches of his wife.

Perplexity: 1116699136.0000

Perplexity: 1879936128.0000

Sentence: two hours afterwards, madame danglars received a most flattering epistle from the count, in which he entreated her to receive back her favorite “dappled grays,” protesting that he could not endure the idea of making his entry into the parisian world of fashion with the knowledge that his splendid equipage had been obtained at the price of a lovely woman’s regrets.
Perplexity: 510188576.0000

Sentence: the horses were sent back wearing the same harness she had seen on them in the morning; only, by the count’s orders, in the centre of each rosette that adorned either side of their heads, had been fastened a large diamond.

Sentence: “i thought i did not mistake.
Perplexity: 163686816.0000

Perplexity: 162459776.0000

Sentence: “a lion even?” ali sprung forwards, imitating the action of one throwing the lasso, then of a strangled lion.
Perplexity: 90231936.0000

Sentence: “i understand,” said monte cristo; “you wish to tell me you have hunted the lion?” ali smiled with triumphant pride as he signified that he had indeed both chased and captured many lions.
Perplexity: 43744224.0000

Sentence: “but do you believe you could arrest the progress of two horses rushing forwards with ungovernable fury?” the nubian smiled.

Sentence: ere long a carriage will dash past here, drawn by the pair of dappled gray horses you saw me with yesterday; now, at the risk of your own life, you must manage to stop those horses before my door.” ali descended to the street, and marked a straight line on the pavement immediately at the entrance of the house, and then pointed out the line he had traced to the count, who was watching him.
Perplexity: 483718208.0000

Sentence: the count patted him gently on the shoulder, his usual mode of praising ali, who, pleased and gratified with the commission assigned him, walked calmly towards a projecting stone forming the angle of the street and house, and, seating himself thereon, began to smoke his chibouque, while monte cristo re-entered his dwelling, perfectly assured of the success of his plan.
Perplexity: 843047680.0000

Sentence: still, as five o’clock approached, and the carriage was momentarily expected by the count, the indication of more than common impatience and uneasiness might be observed in his manner.
Perplexity: 940360384.0000

Sentence: he stationed himself in a room commanding a view of the street, pacing the chamber with restless steps, stopping merely to listen from time to time for the sound of approaching wheels, then to cast an anxious glance on ali; but the regularity with which the nubian puffed forth the smoke of his chibouque proved that he at least was wholly absorbed in the enjoyment of his favorite occupation.
Perplexity: 321023456.0000

Sentence: suddenly a distant sound of rapidly advancing wheels was heard, and almost immediately a carriage appeared, drawn by a pair of wild, ungovernable horses, while the terrified coachman strove in vain to restrain their furious speed.

Perplexity: 1353228160.0000

Sentence: ali suddenly cast aside his chibouque, drew the lasso from his pocket, threw it so skilfully as to catch the forelegs of the near horse in its triple fold, and suffered himself to be dragged on for a few steps by the violence of the shock, then the animal fell over on the pole, which snapped, and therefore prevented the other horse from pursuing its way.
Perplexity: 98000400.0000

Sentence: gladly availing himself of this opportunity, the coachman leaped from his box; but ali had promptly seized the nostrils of the second horse, and held them in his iron grasp, till the beast, snorting with pain, sunk beside his companion.

Perplexity: 106430384.0000

Sentence: “i understand the nature of your alarms, madame,” said the count, carefully examining the child, “but i assure you there is not the slightest occasion for uneasiness; your little charge has not received the least injury; his insensibility is merely the effects of terror, and will soon pass.” “are you quite sure you do not say so to tranquillize my fears?

Sentence: oh, sir, in pity send for a physician; my whole fortune shall not be thought too much for the recovery of my boy.” with a calm smile and a gentle wave of the hand, monte cristo signed to the distracted mother to lay aside her apprehensions; then, opening a casket that stood near, he drew forth a phial of bohemian glass incrusted with gold, containing a liquid of the color of blood, of which he let fall a single drop on the child’s lips.

Perplexity: 247920112.0000

Sentence: “all paris rung with the praises of madame danglars’ beautiful horses, and i had the folly to desire to know whether they really merited the high praise given to them.” “is it possible,” exclaimed the count with well-feigned astonishment, “that these horses belong to the baroness?” “they do, indeed.
Perplexity: 196156112.0000

Sentence: may i inquire if you are acquainted with madame danglars?” 20351m “i have that honor; and my happiness at your escape from the danger that threatened you is redoubled by the consciousness that i have been the unwilling and the unintentional cause of all the peril you have incurred.
Perplexity: 62764776.0000

Sentence: i yesterday purchased these horses of the baron; but as the baroness evidently regretted parting with them, i ventured to send them back to her, with a request that she would gratify me by accepting them from my hands.” “you are, then, doubtless, the count of monte cristo, of whom hermine has talked to me so much?” “you have rightly guessed, madame,” replied the count.
Perplexity: 2443947520.0000

Perplexity: 90918128.0000

Perplexity: 307967712.0000

Sentence: his mouth was large, and the lips, which had not yet regained their color, were particularly thin; in fact, the deep and crafty look, giving a predominant expression to the child’s face, belonged rather to a boy of twelve or fourteen than to one so young.
Perplexity: 240395088.0000

Sentence: his first movement was to free himself by a violent push from the encircling arms of his mother, and to rush forward to the casket from whence the count had taken the phial of elixir; then, without asking permission of anyone, he proceeded, in all the wilfulness of a spoiled child unaccustomed to restrain either whims or caprices, to pull the corks out of all the bottles.
Perplexity: 389870176.0000

Sentence: “touch nothing, my little friend,” cried the count eagerly; “some of those liquids are not only dangerous to taste, but even to inhale.” madame de villefort became very pale, and, seizing her son’s arm, drew him anxiously toward her; but, once satisfied of his safety, she also cast a brief but expressive glance on the casket, which was not lost upon the count.

Sentence: thank him, then, my child, in your very best manner; for, had he not come to our aid, neither you nor i would have been alive to speak our thanks.” the child stuck out his lips and turned away his head in a disdainful manner, saying, “he’s too ugly.” 20353m the count smiled as if the child bade fair to realize his hopes, while madame de villefort reprimanded her son with a gentleness and moderation very far from conveying the least idea of a fault having been committed.
Perplexity: 61892668.0000

Sentence: “this lady,” said the count, speaking to ali in the arabic language, “is desirous that her son should thank you for saving both their lives; but the boy refuses, saying you are too ugly.” ali turned his intelligent countenance towards the boy, on whom he gazed without any apparent emotion; but the spasmodic working of the nostrils showed to the practiced eye of monte cristo that the arab had been wounded to the heart.
Perplexity: 407484640.0000

Sentence: “will you permit me to inquire,” said madame de villefort, as she arose to take her leave, “whether you usually reside here?” “no, i do not,” replied monte cristo; “it is a small place i have purchased quite lately.

Perplexity: 41228540.0000

Perplexity: 2814313216.0000

Sentence: with him they will be gentle and docile as lambs.” ali had, indeed, given proof of this; for, approaching the animals, who had been got upon their legs with considerable difficulty, he rubbed their foreheads and nostrils with a sponge soaked in aromatic vinegar, and wiped off the sweat and foam that covered their mouths.
Perplexity: 1176344192.0000

Sentence: then, commencing a loud whistling noise, he rubbed them well all over their bodies for several minutes; then, undisturbed by the noisy crowd collected round the broken carriage, ali quietly harnessed the pacified animals to the count’s chariot, took the reins in his hands, and mounted the box, when to the utter astonishment of those who had witnessed the ungovernable spirit and maddened speed of the same horses, he was actually compelled to apply his whip in no very gentle manner before he could induce them to start; and even then all that could be obtained from the celebrated “dappled grays,” now changed into a couple of dull, sluggish, stupid brutes, was a slow, pottering pace, kept up with so much difficulty that madame de villefort was more than two hours returning to her residence in the faubourg saint-honoré.
Perplexity: 461598848.0000

Sentence: 20355m scarcely had the first congratulations upon her marvellous escape been gone through when she wrote the following letter to madame danglars:— “dear hermine,—i have just had a wonderful escape from the most imminent danger, and i owe my safety to the very count of monte cristo we were talking about yesterday, but whom i little expected to see today.
Perplexity: 13262604288.0000

Sentence: i remember how unmercifully i laughed at what i considered your eulogistic and exaggerated praises of him; but i have now ample cause to admit that your enthusiastic description of this wonderful man fell far short of his merits.
Perplexity: 187629200.0000

Sentence: your horses got as far as ranelagh, when they darted forward like mad things, and galloped away at so fearful a rate, that there seemed no other prospect for myself and my poor edward but that of being dashed to pieces against the first object that impeded their progress, when a strange-looking man,—an arab, a negro, or a nubian, at least a black of some nation or other—at a signal from the count, whose domestic he is, suddenly seized and stopped the infuriated animals, even at the risk of being trampled to death himself; and certainly he must have had a most wonderful escape.

Sentence: 20356m adieu!
Perplexity: 286048544.0000

Sentence: i cannot return you many thanks for the drive of yesterday; but, after all, i ought not to blame you for the misconduct of your horses, more especially as it procured me the pleasure of an introduction to the count of monte cristo,—and certainly that illustrious personage, apart from the millions he is said to be so very anxious to dispose of, seemed to me one of those curiously interesting problems i, for one, delight in solving at any risk, even if it were to necessitate another drive to the bois behind your horses.
Perplexity: 77621168.0000

Perplexity: 484728640.0000

Sentence: albert related it to his mother; château-renaud recounted it at the jockey club, and debray detailed it at length in the salons of the minister; even beauchamp accorded twenty lines in his journal to the relation of the count’s courage and gallantry, thereby celebrating him as the greatest hero of the day in the eyes of all the feminine members of the aristocracy.
Perplexity: 442086784.0000

Sentence: vast was the crowd of visitors and inquiring friends who left their names at the residence of madame de villefort, with the design of renewing their visit at the right moment, of hearing from her lips all the interesting circumstances of this most romantic adventure.
Perplexity: 36182464.0000

Sentence: 30 in the avenue des champs-élysées.
Perplexity: 89781464.0000

Sentence: ideology if the count of monte cristo had been for a long time familiar with the ways of parisian society, he would have appreciated better the significance of the step which m. de villefort had taken.
Perplexity: 866196480.0000

Sentence: standing well at court, whether the king regnant was of the older or younger branch, whether the government was doctrinaire liberal, or conservative; looked upon by all as a man of talent, since those who have never experienced a political check are generally so regarded; hated by many, but warmly supported by others, without being really liked by anybody, m. de villefort held a high position in the magistracy, and maintained his eminence like a harlay or a molé.
Perplexity: 121649832.0000

Sentence: his drawing-room, under the regenerating influence of a young wife and a daughter by his first marriage, scarcely eighteen, was still one of the well-regulated paris salons where the worship of traditional customs and the observance of rigid etiquette were carefully maintained.
Perplexity: 39060016.0000

Perplexity: 945188480.0000

Perplexity: 2461885184.0000

Sentence: perhaps this would not have been so had it been possible to get rid of m. de villefort; but, like the feudal barons who rebelled against their sovereign, he dwelt in an impregnable fortress.
Perplexity: 100289984.0000

Sentence: this fortress was his post as king’s attorney, all the advantages of which he exploited with marvellous skill, and which he would not have resigned but to be made deputy, and thus to replace neutrality by opposition.

Sentence: ordinarily m. de villefort made and returned very few visits.
Perplexity: 238887648.0000

Sentence: his wife visited for him, and this was the received thing in the world, where the weighty and multifarious occupations of the magistrate were accepted as an excuse for what was really only calculated pride, a manifestation of professed superiority—in fact, the application of the axiom, _pretend to think well of yourself, and the world will think well of you_, an axiom a hundred times more useful in society nowadays than that of the greeks, “know thyself,” a knowledge for which, in our days, we have substituted the less difficult and more advantageous science of _knowing others_.
Perplexity: 378454336.0000

Sentence: to his friends m. de villefort was a powerful protector; to his enemies, he was a silent, but bitter opponent; for those who were neither the one nor the other, he was a statue of the law-made man.

Perplexity: 179647968.0000

Sentence: he dressed entirely in black, with the exception of his white tie, and his funeral appearance was only mitigated by the slight line of red ribbon which passed almost imperceptibly through his button-hole, and appeared like a streak of blood traced with a delicate brush.
Perplexity: 89087368.0000

Sentence: although master of himself, monte cristo, scrutinized with irrepressible curiosity the magistrate whose salute he returned, and who, distrustful by habit, and especially incredulous as to social prodigies, was much more despised to look upon “the noble stranger,” as monte cristo was already called, as an adventurer in search of new fields, or an escaped criminal, rather than as a prince of the holy see, or a sultan of the _thousand and one nights_.
Perplexity: 3505603840.0000

Sentence: “sir,” said villefort, in the squeaky tone assumed by magistrates in their oratorical periods, and of which they cannot, or will not, divest themselves in society, “sir, the signal service which you yesterday rendered to my wife and son has made it a duty for me to offer you my thanks.
Perplexity: 389583264.0000

Sentence: i have come, therefore, to discharge this duty, and to express to you my overwhelming gratitude.” and as he said this, the “eye severe” of the magistrate had lost nothing of its habitual arrogance.
Perplexity: 375391744.0000

Sentence: he spoke in a voice of the procureur-general, with the rigid inflexibility of neck and shoulders which caused his flatterers to say (as we have before observed) that he was the living statue of the law.
Perplexity: 676613696.0000

Sentence: “monsieur,” replied the count, with a chilling air, “i am very happy to have been the means of preserving a son to his mother, for they say that the sentiment of maternity is the most holy of all; and the good fortune which occurred to me, monsieur, might have enabled you to dispense with a duty which, in its discharge, confers an undoubtedly great honor; for i am aware that m. de villefort is not usually lavish of the favor which he now bestows on me,—a favor which, however estimable, is unequal to the satisfaction which i have in my own consciousness.” villefort, astonished at this reply, which he by no means expected, started like a soldier who feels the blow levelled at him over the armor he wears, and a curl of his disdainful lip indicated that from that moment he noted in the tablets of his brain that the count of monte cristo was by no means a highly bred gentleman.
Perplexity: 653082816.0000

Sentence: he glanced around, in order to seize on something on which the conversation might turn, and seemed to fall easily on a topic.
Perplexity: 351066080.0000

Sentence: he saw the map which monte cristo had been examining when he entered, and said: “you seem geographically engaged, sir?
Perplexity: 191964064.0000

Sentence: it is a rich study for you, who, as i learn, have seen as many lands as are delineated on this map.” “yes, sir,” replied the count; “i have sought to make of the human race, taken in the mass, what you practice every day on individuals—a physiological study.
Perplexity: 143254896.0000

Sentence: i have believed it was much easier to descend from the whole to a part than to ascend from a part to the whole.
Perplexity: 8732253184.0000

Sentence: it is an algebraic axiom, which makes us proceed from a known to an unknown quantity, and not from an unknown to a known; but sit down, sir, i beg of you.” monte cristo pointed to a chair, which the procureur was obliged to take the trouble to move forwards himself, while the count merely fell back into his own, on which he had been kneeling when m. villefort entered.
Perplexity: 81719984.0000

Sentence: thus the count was halfway turned towards his visitor, having his back towards the window, his elbow resting on the geographical chart which furnished the theme of conversation for the moment,—a conversation which assumed, as in the case of the interviews with danglars and morcerf, a turn analogous to the persons, if not to the situation.
Perplexity: 170214192.0000

Sentence: “ah, you philosophize,” replied villefort, after a moment’s silence, during which, like a wrestler who encounters a powerful opponent, he took breath; “well, sir, really, if, like you, i had nothing else to do, i should seek a more amusing occupation.” “why, in truth, sir,” was monte cristo’s reply, “man is but an ugly caterpillar for him who studies him through a solar microscope; but you said, i think, that i had nothing else to do.
Perplexity: 530778432.0000

Sentence: now, really, let me ask, sir, have you?—do you believe you have anything to do?
Perplexity: 473872096.0000

Sentence: or to speak in plain terms, do you really think that what you do deserves being called anything?” villefort’s astonishment redoubled at this second thrust so forcibly made by his strange adversary.
Perplexity: 369337152.0000

Sentence: it was a long time since the magistrate had heard a paradox so strong, or rather, to say the truth more exactly, it was the first time he had ever heard of it.
Perplexity: 1703691904.0000

Sentence: the procureur exerted himself to reply.
Perplexity: 182556736.0000

Sentence: “sir,” he responded, “you are a stranger, and i believe you say yourself that a portion of your life has been spent in oriental countries, so you are not aware how human justice, so expeditious in barbarous countries, takes with us a prudent and well-studied course.” “oh, yes—yes, i do, sir; it is the _pede claudo_ of the ancients.
Perplexity: 212913664.0000

Sentence: i know all that, for it is with the justice of all countries especially that i have occupied myself—it is with the criminal procedure of all nations that i have compared natural justice, and i must say, sir, that it is the law of primitive nations, that is, the law of retaliation, that i have most frequently found to be according to the law of god.” “if this law were adopted, sir,” said the procureur, “it would greatly simplify our legal codes, and in that case the magistrates would not (as you just observed) have much to do.” “it may, perhaps, come to this in time,” observed monte cristo; “you know that human inventions march from the complex to the simple, and simplicity is always perfection.” “in the meanwhile,” continued the magistrate, “our codes are in full force, with all their contradictory enactments derived from gallic customs, roman laws, and frank usages; the knowledge of all which, you will agree, is not to be acquired without extended labor; it needs tedious study to acquire this knowledge, and, when acquired, a strong power of brain to retain it.” “i agree with you entirely, sir; but all that even you know with respect to the french code, i know, not only in reference to that code, but as regards the codes of all nations.
Perplexity: 162121440.0000

Sentence: the english, turkish, japanese, hindu laws, are as familiar to me as the french laws, and thus i was right, when i said to you, that relatively (you know that everything is relative, sir)—that relatively to what i have done, you have very little to do; but that relatively to all i have learned, you have yet a great deal to learn.” “but with what motive have you learned all this?” inquired villefort, in astonishment.
Perplexity: 27034004.0000

Sentence: monte cristo smiled.
Perplexity: 1147143040.0000

Sentence: “really, sir,” he observed, “i see that in spite of the reputation which you have acquired as a superior man, you look at everything from the material and vulgar view of society, beginning with man, and ending with man—that is to say, in the most restricted, most narrow view which it is possible for human understanding to embrace.” “pray, sir, explain yourself,” said villefort, more and more astonished, “i really do—not—understand you—perfectly.” “i say, sir, that with the eyes fixed on the social organization of nations, you see only the springs of the machine, and lose sight of the sublime workman who makes them act; i say that you do not recognize before you and around you any but those office-holders whose commissions have been signed by a minister or king; and that the men whom god has put above those office-holders, ministers, and kings, by giving them a mission to follow out, instead of a post to fill—i say that they escape your narrow, limited field of observation.
Perplexity: 196150496.0000

Sentence: it is thus that human weakness fails, from its debilitated and imperfect organs.
Perplexity: 149750624.0000

Perplexity: 135376176.0000

Sentence: the nations took attila, who was doomed to destroy them, for a conqueror similar to other conquerors, and it was necessary for both to reveal their missions, that they might be known and acknowledged; one was compelled to say, ‘i am the angel of the lord’; and the other, ‘i am the hammer of god,’ in order that the divine essence in both might be revealed.” “then,” said villefort, more and more amazed, and really supposing he was speaking to a mystic or a madman, “you consider yourself as one of those extraordinary beings whom you have mentioned?” “and why not?” said monte cristo coldly.
Perplexity: 2138310912.0000

Sentence: “your pardon, sir,” replied villefort, quite astounded, “but you will excuse me if, when i presented myself to you, i was unaware that i should meet with a person whose knowledge and understanding so far surpass the usual knowledge and understanding of men.
Perplexity: 40349756.0000

Sentence: it is not usual with us corrupted wretches of civilization to find gentlemen like yourself, possessors, as you are, of immense fortune—at least, so it is said—and i beg you to observe that i do not inquire, i merely repeat;—it is not usual, i say, for such privileged and wealthy beings to waste their time in speculations on the state of society, in philosophical reveries, intended at best to console those whom fate has disinherited from the goods of this world.” “really, sir,” retorted the count, “have you attained the eminent situation in which you are, without having admitted, or even without having met with exceptions?
Perplexity: 22143774.0000

Sentence: and do you never use your eyes, which must have acquired so much _finesse_ and certainty, to divine, at a glance, the kind of man by whom you are confronted?
Perplexity: 85167296.0000

Sentence: should not a magistrate be not merely the best administrator of the law, but the most crafty expounder of the chicanery of his profession, a steel probe to search hearts, a touchstone to try the gold which in each soul is mingled with more or less of alloy?” “sir,” said villefort, “upon my word, you overcome me.
Perplexity: 28733506.0000

Sentence: i really never heard a person speak as you do.” “because you remain eternally encircled in a round of general conditions, and have never dared to raise your wings into those upper spheres which god has peopled with invisible or exceptional beings.” “and you allow then, sir, that spheres exist, and that these marked and invisible beings mingle amongst us?” “why should they not?
Perplexity: 2101572992.0000

Sentence: can you see the air you breathe, and yet without which you could not for a moment exist?” “then we do not see those beings to whom you allude?” “yes, we do; you see them whenever god pleases to allow them to assume a material form.
Perplexity: 35552680.0000

Sentence: you touch them, come in contact with them, speak to them, and they reply to you.” “ah,” said villefort, smiling, “i confess i should like to be warned when one of these beings is in contact with me.” “you have been served as you desire, monsieur, for you were warned just now, and i now again warn you.” “then you yourself are one of these marked beings?” “yes, monsieur, i believe so; for until now, no man has found himself in a position similar to mine.
Perplexity: 144217728.0000

Sentence: the dominions of kings are limited either by mountains or rivers, or a change of manners, or an alteration of language.
Perplexity: 39971580.0000

Perplexity: 54117248.0000

Sentence: you may, therefore, comprehend, that being of no country, asking no protection from any government, acknowledging no man as my brother, not one of the scruples that arrest the powerful, or the obstacles which paralyze the weak, paralyzes or arrests me.
Perplexity: 17323358.0000

Sentence: i have only two adversaries—i will not say two conquerors, for with perseverance i subdue even them,—they are time and distance.

Sentence: there is a third, and the most terrible—that is my condition as a mortal being.
Perplexity: 23523506.0000

Sentence: what men call the chances of fate—namely, ruin, change, circumstances—i have fully anticipated, and if any of these should overtake me, yet it will not overwhelm me.
Perplexity: 69402752.0000

Sentence: unless i die, i shall always be what i am, and therefore it is that i utter the things you have never heard, even from the mouths of kings—for kings have need, and other persons have fear of you.
Perplexity: 237065216.0000

Sentence: for who is there who does not say to himself, in a society as incongruously organized as ours, ‘perhaps some day i shall have to do with the king’s attorney’?” “but can you not say that, sir?
Perplexity: 98058928.0000

Sentence: the moment you become an inhabitant of france, you are naturally subjected to the french law.” “i know it sir,” replied monte cristo; “but when i visit a country i begin to study, by all the means which are available, the men from whom i may have anything to hope or to fear, till i know them as well as, perhaps better than, they know themselves.
Perplexity: 303949888.0000

Sentence: it follows from this, that the king’s attorney, be he who he may, with whom i should have to deal, would assuredly be more embarrassed than i should.” “that is to say,” replied villefort with hesitation, “that human nature being weak, every man, according to your creed, has committed faults.” “faults or crimes,” responded monte cristo with a negligent air.
Perplexity: 696526336.0000

Sentence: “and that you alone, amongst the men whom you do not recognize as your brothers—for you have said so,” observed villefort in a tone that faltered somewhat—“you alone are perfect.” “no, not perfect,” was the count’s reply; “only impenetrable, that’s all.
Perplexity: 480099456.0000

Sentence: but let us leave off this strain, sir, if the tone of it is displeasing to you; i am no more disturbed by your justice than are you by my second-sight.” “no, no,—by no means,” said villefort, who was afraid of seeming to abandon his ground.
Perplexity: 1102883200.0000

Sentence: “no; by your brilliant and almost sublime conversation you have elevated me above the ordinary level; we no longer talk, we rise to dissertation.

Perplexity: 250752112.0000

Sentence: “but,” continued she, “lord wilmore had a family or friends, he must have known someone, can we not——” “oh, it is useless to inquire,” returned the count; “perhaps, after all, he was not the man you seek for.

Perplexity: 377018432.0000

Sentence: in matters of speculation, however, though “man proposes,” yet “money disposes.” from some such difficulty the newly named street died almost in birth, and the purchaser of the kitchen-garden, having paid a high price for it, and being quite unable to find anyone willing to take his bargain off his hands without a considerable loss, yet still clinging to the belief that at some future day he should obtain a sum for it that would repay him, not only for his past outlay, but also the interest upon the capital locked up in his new acquisition, contented himself with letting the ground temporarily to some market-gardeners, at a yearly rental of 500 francs.

Sentence: towards the house the chestnut-trees we have before mentioned rose high above the wall, without in any way affecting the growth of other luxuriant shrubs and flowers that eagerly dressed forward to fill up the vacant spaces, as though asserting their right to enjoy the boon of light and air.

Perplexity: 213746976.0000

Sentence: whoever had selected this retired portion of the grounds as the boundary of a walk, or as a place for meditation, was abundantly justified in the choice by the absence of all glare, the cool, refreshing shade, the screen it afforded from the scorching rays of the sun, that found no entrance there even during the burning days of hottest summer, the incessant and melodious warbling of birds, and the entire removal from either the noise of the street or the bustle of the mansion.

Perplexity: 244885520.0000

Perplexity: 55677932.0000

Sentence: then, too, my father is not a person whose orders may be infringed with impunity; protected as he is by his high position and firmly established reputation for talent and unswerving integrity, no one could oppose him; he is all-powerful even with the king; he would crush you at a word.

Perplexity: 4189069568.0000

Sentence: oh, if my mother were still living, there would be nothing to fear, maximilian, for i would tell her that i loved you, and she would protect us.” “i fear, valentine,” replied the lover, “that were she living i should never have had the happiness of knowing you; you would then have been too happy to have stooped from your grandeur to bestow a thought on me.” “now it is you who are unjust, maximilian,” cried valentine; “but there is one thing i wish to know.” “and what is that?” inquired the young man, perceiving that valentine hesitated.

Perplexity: 144784112.0000

Sentence: while the rest of the company were discussing the approaching marriage of mademoiselle danglars, i was reading the paper to my grandfather; but when i came to the paragraph about you, although i had done nothing else but read it over to myself all the morning (you know you had told me all about it the previous evening), i felt so happy, and yet so nervous, at the idea of speaking your name aloud, and before so many people, that i really think i should have passed it over, but for the fear that my doing so might create suspicions as to the cause of my silence; so i summoned up all my courage, and read it as firmly and as steadily as i could.” 30059m “dear valentine!” “well, would you believe it?
Perplexity: 82725232.0000

Sentence: directly my father caught the sound of your name he turned round quite hastily, and, like a poor silly thing, i was so persuaded that everyone must be as much affected as myself by the utterance of your name, that i was not surprised to see my father start, and almost tremble; but i even thought (though that surely must have been a mistake) that m. danglars trembled too.” “‘morrel, morrel,’ cried my father, ‘stop a bit;’ then knitting his brows into a deep frown, he added, ‘surely this cannot be one of the morrel family who lived at marseilles, and gave us so much trouble from their violent bonapartism—i mean about the year 1815.’ “‘yes,’ replied m. danglars, ‘i believe he is the son of the old shipowner.’” “indeed,” answered maximilian; “and what did your father say then, valentine?” “oh, such a dreadful thing, that i don’t dare to tell you.” “always tell me everything,” said maximilian with a smile.
Perplexity: 448301536.0000

Sentence: “‘ah,’ continued my father, still frowning, ‘their idolized emperor treated these madmen as they deserved; he called them ‘food for cannon,’ which was precisely all they were good for; and i am delighted to see that the present government have adopted this salutary principle with all its pristine vigor; if algiers were good for nothing but to furnish the means of carrying so admirable an idea into practice, it would be an acquisition well worthy of struggling to obtain.
Perplexity: 123409848.0000

Perplexity: 127055592.0000

Sentence: but what did m. danglars say to this outburst on the part of the procureur?” “oh, he laughed, and in that singular manner so peculiar to himself—half-malicious, half-ferocious; he almost immediately got up and took his leave; then, for the first time, i observed the agitation of my grandfather, and i must tell you, maximilian, that i am the only person capable of discerning emotion in his paralyzed frame.
Perplexity: 152511216.0000

Sentence: and i suspected that the conversation that had been carried on in his presence (for they always say and do what they like before the dear old man, without the smallest regard for his feelings) had made a strong impression on his mind; for, naturally enough, it must have pained him to hear the emperor he so devotedly loved and served spoken of in that depreciating manner.” “the name of m. noirtier,” interposed maximilian, “is celebrated throughout europe; he was a statesman of high standing, and you may or may not know, valentine, that he took a leading part in every bonapartist conspiracy set on foot during the restoration of the bourbons.” “oh, i have often heard whispers of things that seem to me most strange—the father a bonapartist, the son a royalist; what can have been the reason of so singular a difference in parties and politics?
Perplexity: 77251632.0000

Perplexity: 359308448.0000

Sentence: perhaps it was a mere whim on his part, for he is falling, they say, into second childhood, but i love him for showing so much interest in you.” “how singular,” murmured maximilian; “your father hates me, while your grandfather, on the contrary—what strange feelings are aroused by politics.” “hush,” cried valentine, suddenly; “someone is coming!” maximilian leaped at one bound into his crop of lucern, which he began to pull up in the most ruthless way, under the pretext of being occupied in weeding it.
Perplexity: 92751832.0000

Sentence: “mademoiselle, mademoiselle!” exclaimed a voice from behind the trees.
Perplexity: 155012816.0000

Perplexity: 139396160.0000

Sentence: madame de villefort, who was alone in her drawing-room when the count was announced, desired that her son might be brought thither instantly to renew his thanks to the count; and edward, who heard this great personage talked of for two whole days, made all possible haste to come to him, not from obedience to his mother, or out of any feeling of gratitude to the count, but from sheer curiosity, and that some chance remark might give him the opportunity for making one of the impertinent speeches which made his mother say: “oh, that naughty child!

Perplexity: 474438240.0000

Sentence: madame de villefort merely cried, “be still, edward!” she then added, “this young madcap is, however, very nearly right, and merely re-echoes what he has heard me say with pain a hundred times; for mademoiselle de villefort is, in spite of all we can do to rouse her, of a melancholy disposition and taciturn habit, which frequently injure the effect of her beauty.

Sentence: “but, madame,” replied the count, continuing the conversation, and looking by turns at madame de villefort and valentine, “have i not already had the honor of meeting yourself and mademoiselle before?
Perplexity: 936642432.0000

Sentence: i could not help thinking so just now; the idea came over my mind, and as mademoiselle entered the sight of her was an additional ray of light thrown on a confused remembrance; excuse the remark.” “i do not think it likely, sir; mademoiselle de villefort is not very fond of society, and we very seldom go out,” said the young lady.
Perplexity: 120593608.0000

Perplexity: 133171656.0000

Sentence: “no—it was somewhere—away from here—it was—i do not know—but it appears that this recollection is connected with a lovely sky and some religious _fête_; mademoiselle was holding flowers in her hand, the interesting boy was chasing a beautiful peacock in a garden, and you, madame, were under the trellis of some arbor.
Perplexity: 1117446912.0000

Sentence: pray come to my aid, madame; do not these circumstances appeal to your memory?” “no, indeed,” replied madame de villefort; “and yet it appears to me, sir, that if i had met you anywhere, the recollection of you must have been imprinted on my memory.” “perhaps the count saw us in italy,” said valentine timidly.

Sentence: i have studied chemistry because, having determined to live in eastern climates i have been desirous of following the example of king mithridates.” “_mithridates, rex ponticus_,” said the young scamp, as he tore some beautiful portraits out of a splendid album, “the individual who took cream in his cup of poison every morning at breakfast.” “edward, you naughty boy,” exclaimed madame de villefort, snatching the mutilated book from the urchin’s grasp, “you are positively past bearing; you really disturb the conversation; go, leave us, and join your sister valentine in dear grandpapa noirtier’s room.” “the album,” said edward sulkily.

Perplexity: 3158103808.0000

Sentence: he has but one fault, he is somewhat wilful; but really, on referring for the moment to what he said, do you truly believe that mithridates used these precautions, and that these precautions were efficacious?” “i think so, madame, because i myself have made use of them, that i might not be poisoned at naples, at palermo, and at smyrna—that is to say, on three several occasions when, but for these precautions, i must have lost my life.” “and your precautions were successful?” “completely so.” “yes, i remember now your mentioning to me at perugia something of this sort.” “indeed?” said the count with an air of surprise, remarkably well counterfeited; “i really did not remember.” “i inquired of you if poisons acted equally, and with the same effect, on men of the north as on men of the south; and you answered me that the cold and sluggish habits of the north did not present the same aptitude as the rich and energetic temperaments of the natives of the south.” “and that is the case,” observed monte cristo.

Perplexity: 62376548.0000

Sentence: the two favorite studies of my youth were botany and mineralogy, and subsequently, when i learned that the use of simples frequently explained the whole history of a people, and the entire life of individuals in the east, as flowers betoken and symbolize a love affair, i have regretted that i was not a man, that i might have been a flamel, a fontana, or a cabanis.” “and the more, madame,” said monte cristo, “as the orientals do not confine themselves, as did mithridates, to make a cuirass of his poisons, but they also made them a dagger.

Sentence: “they are indeed exquisite,” he said; “but as they are necessarily submitted to the process of deglutition—a function which it is frequently impossible for a fainting person to accomplish—i prefer my own specific.” “undoubtedly, and so should i prefer it, after the effects i have seen produced; but of course it is a secret, and i am not so indiscreet as to ask it of you.” “but i,” said monte cristo, rising as he spoke—“i am gallant enough to offer it you.” 30079m “how kind you are.” “only remember one thing—a small dose is a remedy, a large one is poison.
Perplexity: 26674850.0000

Sentence: one drop will restore life, as you have seen; five or six will inevitably kill, and in a way the more terrible inasmuch as, poured into a glass of wine, it would not in the slightest degree affect its flavor.
Perplexity: 71848944.0000

Sentence: but i say no more, madame; it is really as if i were prescribing for you.” the clock struck half-past six, and a lady was announced, a friend of madame de villefort, who came to dine with her.
Perplexity: 317256768.0000

Sentence: “if i had had the honor of seeing you for the third or fourth time, count, instead of only for the second,” said madame de villefort; “if i had had the honor of being your friend, instead of only having the happiness of being under an obligation to you, i should insist on detaining you to dinner, and not allow myself to be daunted by a first refusal.” “a thousand thanks, madame,” replied monte cristo “but i have an engagement which i cannot break.
Perplexity: 82867680.0000

Sentence: i have promised to escort to the académie a greek princess of my acquaintance who has never seen your grand opera, and who relies on me to conduct her thither.” “adieu, then, sir, and do not forget the prescription.” “ah, in truth, madame, to do that i must forget the hour’s conversation i have had with you, which is indeed impossible.” monte cristo bowed, and left the house.

Sentence: madame de villefort remained immersed in thought.
Perplexity: 396879328.0000

Perplexity: 58242008.0000

Sentence: “good,” said he, as he went away; “this is a fruitful soil, and i feel certain that the seed sown will not be cast on barren ground.” next morning, faithful to his promise, he sent the prescription requested.
Perplexity: 40554836.0000

Sentence: robert le diable the pretext of an opera engagement was so much the more feasible, as there chanced to be on that very night a more than ordinary attraction at the académie royale.
Perplexity: 868101760.0000

Sentence: levasseur, who had been suffering under severe illness, made his reappearance in the character of _bertram_, and, as usual, the announcement of the most admired production of the favorite composer of the day had attracted a brilliant and fashionable audience.
Perplexity: 193129008.0000

Sentence: morcerf, like most other young men of rank and fortune, had his orchestra stall, with the certainty of always finding a seat in at least a dozen of the principal boxes occupied by persons of his acquaintance; he had, moreover, his right of entry into the omnibus box.
Perplexity: 1671380224.0000

Sentence: château-renaud rented a stall beside his own, while beauchamp, as a journalist, had unlimited range all over the theatre.
Perplexity: 213533472.0000

Sentence: it happened that on this particular night the minister’s box was placed at the disposal of lucien debray, who offered it to the comte de morcerf, who again, upon his rejection of it by mercédès, sent it to danglars, with an intimation that he should probably do himself the honor of joining the baroness and her daughter during the evening, in the event of their accepting the box in question.
Perplexity: 27435176.0000

Sentence: the ladies received the offer with too much pleasure to dream of a refusal.
Perplexity: 85813984.0000

Sentence: to no class of persons is the presentation of a gratuitous opera-box more acceptable than to the wealthy millionaire, who still hugs economy while boasting of carrying a king’s ransom in his waistcoat pocket.
Perplexity: 381936544.0000

Sentence: danglars had, however, protested against showing himself in a ministerial box, declaring that his political principles, and his parliamentary position as member of the opposition party would not permit him so to commit himself; the baroness had, therefore, despatched a note to lucien debray, bidding him call for them, it being wholly impossible for her to go alone with eugénie to the opera.
Perplexity: 644792448.0000

Sentence: there is no gainsaying the fact that a very unfavorable construction would have been put upon the circumstance if the two women had gone without escort, while the addition of a third, in the person of her mother’s admitted lover, enabled mademoiselle danglars to defy malice and ill-nature.
Perplexity: 115496264.0000

Sentence: one must take the world as one finds it.
Perplexity: 174702288.0000

Sentence: 30083m the curtain rose, as usual, to an almost empty house, it being one of the absurdities of parisian fashion never to appear at the opera until after the beginning of the performance, so that the first act is generally played without the slightest attention being paid to it, that part of the audience already assembled being too much occupied in observing the fresh arrivals, while nothing is heard but the noise of opening and shutting doors, and the buzz of conversation.
Perplexity: 38631768.0000

Sentence: “surely,” said albert, as the door of a box on the first circle opened, “that must be the countess g——.” “and who is the countess g——?” inquired château-renaud.

Sentence: “what a question!
Perplexity: 152366688.0000

Sentence: now, do you know, baron, i have a great mind to pick a quarrel with you for asking it; as if all the world did not know who the countess g—— was.” “ah, to be sure,” replied château-renaud; “the lovely venetian, is it not?” “herself.” at this moment the countess perceived albert, and returned his salutation with a smile.
Perplexity: 21973334.0000

Sentence: “you know her, it seems?” said château-renaud.
Perplexity: 2220279040.0000

Perplexity: 66419252.0000

Perplexity: 30006674.0000

Perplexity: 431142976.0000

Perplexity: 402695840.0000

Sentence: “why, it was won by a horse and rider utterly unknown on the course.” “is that possible?” “true as day.
Perplexity: 240229616.0000

Perplexity: 808131136.0000

Sentence: they were obliged to stuff at least twenty pounds weight of shot in the small rider’s pockets, to make him weight; but with all that he outstripped ariel and barbare, against whom he ran, by at least three whole lengths.” “and was it not found out at last to whom the horse and jockey belonged?” “no.” “you say that the horse was entered under the name of vampa?” “exactly; that was the title.” “then,” answered albert, “i am better informed than you are, and know who the owner of that horse was.” “shut up, there!” cried the pit in chorus.
Perplexity: 193483696.0000

Sentence: and this time the tone and manner in which the command was given, betokened such growing hostility that the two young men perceived, for the first time, that the mandate was addressed to them.
Perplexity: 189696496.0000

Sentence: leisurely turning round, they calmly scrutinized the various countenances around them, as though demanding some one person who would take upon himself the responsibility of what they deemed excessive impertinence; but as no one responded to the challenge, the friends turned again to the front of the theatre, and affected to busy themselves with the stage.
Perplexity: 39817344.0000

Sentence: at this moment the door of the minister’s box opened, and madame danglars, accompanied by her daughter, entered, escorted by lucien debray, who assiduously conducted them to their seats.

Sentence: “ha, ha,” said château-renaud, “here come some friends of yours, viscount!
Perplexity: 166373008.0000

Sentence: what are you looking at there?
Perplexity: 128530728.0000

Sentence: don’t you see they are trying to catch your eye?” albert turned round, just in time to receive a gracious wave of the fan from the baroness; as for mademoiselle eugénie, she scarcely vouchsafed to waste the glances of her large black eyes even upon the business of the stage.
Perplexity: 420451680.0000

Sentence: “i tell you what, my dear fellow,” said château-renaud, “i cannot imagine what objection you can possibly have to mademoiselle danglars—that is, setting aside her want of ancestry and somewhat inferior rank, which by the way i don’t think you care very much about.
Perplexity: 411379904.0000

Sentence: now, barring all that, i mean to say she is a deuced fine girl!” “handsome, certainly,” replied albert, “but not to my taste, which i confess, inclines to something softer, gentler, and more feminine.” “ah, well,” exclaimed château-renaud, who because he had seen his thirtieth summer fancied himself duly warranted in assuming a sort of paternal air with his more youthful friend, “you young people are never satisfied; why, what would you have more?
Perplexity: 1048197760.0000

Sentence: your parents have chosen you a bride built on the model of diana, the huntress, and yet you are not content.” “no, for that very resemblance affrights me; i should have liked something more in the manner of the venus of milo or capua; but this chase-loving diana, continually surrounded by her nymphs, gives me a sort of alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of actæon.” and, indeed, it required but one glance at mademoiselle danglars to comprehend the justness of morcerf’s remark.
Perplexity: 2279774464.0000

Sentence: she was beautiful, but her beauty was of too marked and decided a character to please a fastidious taste; her hair was raven black, but its natural waves seemed somewhat rebellious; her eyes, of the same color as her hair, were surmounted by well-arched brows, whose great defect, however, consisted in an almost habitual frown, while her whole physiognomy wore that expression of firmness and decision so little in accordance with the gentler attributes of her sex—her nose was precisely what a sculptor would have chosen for a chiselled juno.
Perplexity: 1390282112.0000

Sentence: her mouth, which might have been found fault with as too large, displayed teeth of pearly whiteness, rendered still more conspicuous by the brilliant carmine of her lips, contrasting vividly with her naturally pale complexion.
Perplexity: 83745088.0000

Sentence: but that which completed the almost masculine look morcerf found so little to his taste, was a dark mole, of much larger dimensions than these freaks of nature generally are, placed just at the corner of her mouth; and the effect tended to increase the expression of self-dependence that characterized her countenance.
Perplexity: 831408192.0000

Sentence: the rest of mademoiselle eugénie’s person was in perfect keeping with the head just described; she, indeed, reminded one of diana, as château-renaud observed, but her bearing was more haughty and resolute.
Perplexity: 48328088.0000

Sentence: as regarded her attainments, the only fault to be found with them was the same that a fastidious connoisseur might have found with her beauty, that they were somewhat too erudite and masculine for so young a person.
Perplexity: 283339488.0000

Sentence: she was a perfect linguist, a first-rate artist, wrote poetry, and composed music; to the study of the latter she professed to be entirely devoted, following it with an indefatigable perseverance, assisted by a schoolfellow,—a young woman without fortune whose talent promised to develop into remarkable powers as a singer.
Perplexity: 88127096.0000

Sentence: it was rumored that she was an object of almost paternal interest to one of the principal composers of the day, who excited her to spare no pains in the cultivation of her voice, which might hereafter prove a source of wealth and independence.
Perplexity: 77975816.0000

Sentence: but this counsel effectually decided mademoiselle danglars never to commit herself by being seen in public with one destined for a theatrical life; and acting upon this principle, the banker’s daughter, though perfectly willing to allow mademoiselle louise d’armilly (that was the name of the young virtuosa) to practice with her through the day, took especial care not to be seen in her company.
Perplexity: 164607600.0000

Sentence: still, though not actually received at the hôtel danglars in the light of an acknowledged friend, louise was treated with far more kindness and consideration than is usually bestowed on a governess.
Perplexity: 111574048.0000

Sentence: the curtain fell almost immediately after the entrance of madame danglars into her box, the band quitted the orchestra for the accustomed half-hour’s interval allowed between the acts, and the audience were left at liberty to promenade the salon or lobbies, or to pay and receive visits in their respective boxes.
Perplexity: 26674850.0000

Sentence: morcerf and château-renaud were amongst the first to avail themselves of this permission.
Perplexity: 2715024640.0000

Sentence: for an instant the idea struck madame danglars that this eagerness on the part of the young viscount arose from his impatience to join her party, and she whispered her expectations to her daughter, that albert was hurrying to pay his respects to them.
Perplexity: 177206192.0000

Sentence: mademoiselle eugénie, however, merely returned a dissenting movement of the head, while, with a cold smile, she directed the attention of her mother to an opposite box on the first circle, in which sat the countess g——, and where morcerf had just made his appearance.
Perplexity: 182399072.0000

Sentence: 30087m “so we meet again, my travelling friend, do we?” cried the countess, extending her hand to him with all the warmth and cordiality of an old acquaintance; “it was really very good of you to recognize me so quickly, and still more so to bestow your first visit on me.” “be assured,” replied albert, “that if i had been aware of your arrival in paris, and had known your address, i should have paid my respects to you before this.
Perplexity: 178159872.0000

Sentence: allow me to introduce my friend, baron de château-renaud, one of the few true gentlemen now to be found in france, and from whom i have just learned that you were a spectator of the races in the champ-de-mars, yesterday.” château-renaud bowed to the countess.
Perplexity: 575279296.0000

Sentence: “so you were at the races, baron?” inquired the countess eagerly.
Perplexity: 59219128.0000

Sentence: “yes, madame.” “well, then,” pursued madame g—— with considerable animation, “you can probably tell me who won the jockey club stakes?” “i am sorry to say i cannot,” replied the baron; “and i was just asking the same question of albert.” “are you very anxious to know, countess?” asked albert.
Perplexity: 23478010.0000

Sentence: “to know what?” “the name of the owner of the winning horse?” “excessively; only imagine—but do tell me, viscount, whether you really are acquainted with it or no?” “i beg your pardon, madame, but you were about to relate some story, were you not?
Perplexity: 389223040.0000

Sentence: you said, ‘only imagine,’—and then paused.
Perplexity: 103445896.0000

Sentence: pray continue.” “well, then, listen.
Perplexity: 36069116.0000

Sentence: you must know i felt so interested in the splendid roan horse, with his elegant little rider, so tastefully dressed in a pink satin jacket and cap, that i could not help praying for their success with as much earnestness as though the half of my fortune were at stake; and when i saw them outstrip all the others, and come to the winning-post in such gallant style, i actually clapped my hands with joy.
Perplexity: 863344640.0000

Sentence: imagine my surprise, when, upon returning home, the first object i met on the staircase was the identical jockey in the pink jacket!
Perplexity: 760632768.0000

Sentence: i concluded that, by some singular chance, the owner of the winning horse must live in the same hotel as myself; but, as i entered my apartments, i beheld the very gold cup awarded as a prize to the unknown horse and rider.
Perplexity: 282169728.0000

Sentence: inside the cup was a small piece of paper, on which were written these words—‘from lord ruthven to countess g——.’” “precisely; i was sure of it,” said morcerf.
Perplexity: 101899248.0000

Sentence: “sure of what?” “that the owner of the horse was lord ruthven himself.” “what lord ruthven do you mean?” “why, our lord ruthven—the vampire of the salle argentina!” “is it possible?” exclaimed the countess; “is he here in paris?” “to be sure,—why not?” “and you visit him?—meet him at your own house and elsewhere?” “i assure you he is my most intimate friend, and m. de château-renaud has also the honor of his acquaintance.” “but why are you so sure of his being the winner of the jockey club prize?” “was not the winning horse entered by the name of vampa?” “what of that?” “why, do you not recollect the name of the celebrated bandit by whom i was made prisoner?” “oh, yes.” “and from whose hands the count extricated me in so wonderful a manner?” “to be sure, i remember it all now.” “he called himself vampa.
Perplexity: 29838654.0000

Sentence: you see, it’s evident where the count got the name.” “but what could have been his motive for sending the cup to me?” “in the first place, because i had spoken much of you to him, as you may believe; and in the second, because he delighted to see a countrywoman take so lively an interest in his success.” “i trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish remarks we used to make about him?” “i should not like to affirm upon oath that i have not.
Perplexity: 435305920.0000

Sentence: besides, his presenting you the cup under the name of lord ruthven——” “oh, but that is dreadful!
Perplexity: 248489136.0000

Sentence: why, the man must owe me a fearful grudge.” “does his action appear like that of an enemy?” “no; certainly not.” “well, then——” “and so he is in paris?” “yes.” “and what effect does he produce?” “why,” said albert, “he was talked about for a week; then the coronation of the queen of england took place, followed by the theft of mademoiselle mars’s diamonds; and so people talked of something else.” “my good fellow,” said château-renaud, “the count is your friend and you treat him accordingly.
Perplexity: 773529664.0000

Sentence: do not believe what albert is telling you, countess; so far from the sensation excited in the parisian circles by the appearance of the count of monte cristo having abated, i take upon myself to declare that it is as strong as ever.
Perplexity: 152172688.0000

Sentence: his first astounding act upon coming amongst us was to present a pair of horses, worth 32,000 francs, to madame danglars; his second, the almost miraculous preservation of madame de villefort’s life; now it seems that he has carried off the prize awarded by the jockey club.
Perplexity: 2092098304.0000

Sentence: i therefore maintain, in spite of morcerf, that not only is the count the object of interest at this present moment, but also that he will continue to be so for a month longer if he pleases to exhibit an eccentricity of conduct which, after all, may be his ordinary mode of existence.” “perhaps you are right,” said morcerf; “meanwhile, who is in the russian ambassador’s box?” “which box do you mean?” asked the countess.
Perplexity: 157369536.0000

Sentence: “the one between the pillars on the first tier—it seems to have been fitted up entirely afresh.” “did you observe anyone during the first act?” asked château-renaud.
Perplexity: 41460856.0000

Sentence: “where?” “in that box.” “no,” replied the countess, “it was certainly empty during the first act;” then, resuming the subject of their previous conversation, she said, “and so you really believe it was your mysterious count of monte cristo that gained the prize?” “i am sure of it.” “and who afterwards sent the cup to me?” “undoubtedly.” “but i don’t know him,” said the countess; “i have a great mind to return it.” “do no such thing, i beg of you; he would only send you another, formed of a magnificent sapphire, or hollowed out of a gigantic ruby.
Perplexity: 41823032.0000

Sentence: it is his way, and you must take him as you find him.” at this moment the bell rang to announce the drawing up of the curtain for the second act.

Perplexity: 11055817728.0000

Sentence: so now, you are both forewarned.” the young men bowed, and quitted the box.

Perplexity: 52638748.0000

Perplexity: 27277650.0000

Perplexity: 27072810.0000

Perplexity: 50836124.0000

Sentence: upon this occasion an unmistakable sign from madame danglars intimated her desire to see albert in her box directly the curtain fell on the second act, and neither the politeness nor good taste of morcerf would permit his neglecting an invitation so unequivocally given.

Sentence: “my dear fellow,” said debray, “you have come in the nick of time.
Perplexity: 969696256.0000

Sentence: there is madame overwhelming me with questions respecting the count; she insists upon it that i can tell her his birth, education, and parentage, where he came from, and whither he is going.
Perplexity: 193840864.0000

Sentence: being no disciple of cagliostro, i was wholly unable to do this; so, by way of getting out of the scrape, i said, ‘ask morcerf; he has got the whole history of his beloved monte cristo at his fingers’ ends;’ whereupon the baroness signified her desire to see you.” “is it not almost incredible,” said madame danglars, “that a person having at least half a million of secret-service money at his command, should possess so little information?” “let me assure you, madame,” said lucien, “that had i really the sum you mention at my disposal, i would employ it more profitably than in troubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the count of monte cristo, whose only merit in my eyes consists in his being twice as rich as a nabob.
Perplexity: 973008896.0000

Sentence: however, i have turned the business over to morcerf, so pray settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you; for my own part, i care nothing about the count or his mysterious doings.” 30093m “i am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horses worth 32,000 francs, wearing on their heads four diamonds valued at 5,000 francs each.” “he seems to have a mania for diamonds,” said morcerf, smiling, “and i verily believe that, like potemkin, he keeps his pockets filled, for the sake of strewing them along the road, as tom thumb did his flint stones.” “perhaps he has discovered some mine,” said madame danglars.
Perplexity: 284840416.0000

Sentence: “i suppose you know he has an order for unlimited credit on the baron’s banking establishment?” “i was not aware of it,” replied albert, “but i can readily believe it.” “and, further, that he stated to m. danglars his intention of only staying a year in paris, during which time he proposed to spend six millions.
Perplexity: 124092712.0000

Perplexity: 24918718.0000

Perplexity: 106249264.0000

Sentence: “who is this young person, m. de morcerf?” inquired eugénie; “does anybody know?” “mademoiselle,” said albert, replying to this direct appeal, “i can give you very exact information on that subject, as well as on most points relative to the mysterious person of whom we are now conversing—the young woman is a greek.” “so i should suppose by her dress; if you know no more than that, everyone here is as well-informed as yourself.” “i am extremely sorry you find me so ignorant a _cicerone_,” replied morcerf, “but i am reluctantly obliged to confess, i have nothing further to communicate—yes, stay, i do know one thing more, namely, that she is a musician, for one day when i chanced to be breakfasting with the count, i heard the sound of a guzla—it is impossible that it could have been touched by any other finger than her own.” “then your count entertains visitors, does he?” asked madame danglars.
Perplexity: 52412832.0000

Sentence: “indeed he does, and in a most lavish manner, i can assure you.” “i must try and persuade m. danglars to invite him to a ball or dinner, or something of the sort, that he may be compelled to ask us in return.” “what,” said debray, laughing; “do you really mean you would go to his house?” “why not?
Perplexity: 469581280.0000

Perplexity: 111729296.0000

Sentence: however, as far as ali is concerned, i can assure you, the interest he excites is merely from the circumstance of his being your attendant—you, who are at this moment the most celebrated and fashionable person in paris.” “really?

Perplexity: 53687096.0000

Perplexity: 191006080.0000

Sentence: why, if you sought concealment, did you call your horse vampa?” “that was an oversight, certainly,” replied the count; “but tell me, does the count of morcerf never visit the opera?

Perplexity: 46563796.0000

Sentence: it was ali, my nubian slave, who rendered this service to madame de villefort.” “was it ali,” asked the count of morcerf, “who rescued my son from the hands of bandits?” “no, count,” replied monte cristo taking the hand held out to him by the general; “in this instance i may fairly and freely accept your thanks; but you have already tendered them, and fully discharged your debt—if indeed there existed one—and i feel almost mortified to find you still reverting to the subject.
Perplexity: 217754592.0000

Perplexity: 1991456896.0000

Perplexity: 294968288.0000

Sentence: did not you know that, my dear lord?” “something of this i heard in epirus,” said monte cristo; “but the particulars are still unknown to me.

Perplexity: 2434048000.0000

Sentence: a flurry in stocks some days after this meeting, albert de morcerf visited the count of monte cristo at his house in the champs-élysées, which had already assumed that palace-like appearance which the count’s princely fortune enabled him to give even to his most temporary residences.
Perplexity: 614662400.0000

Sentence: he came to renew the thanks of madame danglars which had been already conveyed to the count through the medium of a letter, signed “baronne danglars, _née_ hermine de servieux.” albert was accompanied by lucien debray, who, joining in his friend’s conversation, added some passing compliments, the source of which the count’s talent for finesse easily enabled him to guess.
Perplexity: 51015528.0000

Sentence: he was convinced that lucien’s visit was due to a double feeling of curiosity, the larger half of which sentiment emanated from the rue de la chaussée d’antin.

Sentence: in short, madame danglars, not being able personally to examine in detail the domestic economy and household arrangements of a man who gave away horses worth 30,000 francs and who went to the opera with a greek slave wearing diamonds to the amount of a million of money, had deputed those eyes, by which she was accustomed to see, to give her a faithful account of the mode of life of this incomprehensible person.
Perplexity: 30941536.0000

Sentence: “you are in constant communication with the baron danglars?” the count inquired of albert de morcerf.
Perplexity: 230660688.0000

Sentence: “yes, count, you know what i told you?” “all remains the same, then, in that quarter?” “it is more than ever a settled thing,” said lucien,—and, considering that this remark was all that he was at that time called upon to make, he adjusted the glass to his eye, and biting the top of his gold headed cane, began to make the tour of the apartment, examining the arms and the pictures.
Perplexity: 128181368.0000

Perplexity: 110241792.0000

Sentence: “really,” said monte cristo, lowering his voice, “you do not appear to me to be very enthusiastic on the subject of this marriage.” “mademoiselle danglars is too rich for me,” replied morcerf, “and that frightens me.” “bah,” exclaimed monte cristo, “that’s a fine reason to give.
Perplexity: 28949700.0000

Sentence: are you not rich yourself?” “my father’s income is about 50,000 francs per annum; and he will give me, perhaps, ten or twelve thousand when i marry.” “that, perhaps, might not be considered a large sum, in paris especially,” said the count; “but everything does not depend on wealth, and it is a fine thing to have a good name, and to occupy a high station in society.
Perplexity: 800555456.0000

Sentence: your name is celebrated, your position magnificent; and then the comte de morcerf is a soldier, and it is pleasing to see the integrity of a bayard united to the poverty of a duguesclin; disinterestedness is the brightest ray in which a noble sword can shine.
Perplexity: 281681984.0000

Sentence: as for me, i consider the union with mademoiselle danglars a most suitable one; she will enrich you, and you will ennoble her.” albert shook his head, and looked thoughtful.

Perplexity: 2276459008.0000

Sentence: “i confess,” observed monte cristo, “that i have some difficulty in comprehending your objection to a young lady who is both rich and beautiful.” “oh,” said morcerf, “this repugnance, if repugnance it may be called, is not all on my side.” “whence can it arise, then?
Perplexity: 40546560.0000

Sentence: for you told me your father desired the marriage.” “it is my mother who dissents; she has a clear and penetrating judgment, and does not smile on the proposed union.
Perplexity: 160130928.0000

Sentence: i cannot account for it, but she seems to entertain some prejudice against the danglars.” 30107m “ah,” said the count, in a somewhat forced tone, “that may be easily explained; the comtesse de morcerf, who is aristocracy and refinement itself, does not relish the idea of being allied by your marriage with one of ignoble birth; that is natural enough.” “i do not know if that is her reason,” said albert, “but one thing i do know, that if this marriage be consummated, it will render her quite miserable.
Perplexity: 160895408.0000

Sentence: there was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in order to talk over and settle the affair; but i had such a sudden attack of indisposition——” “real?” interrupted the count, smiling.

Perplexity: 1082022016.0000

Sentence: how happy you are in being exempt from all this!” “well, and why should not you be free, too?
Perplexity: 112196768.0000

Sentence: what prevents you from being so?” “oh, it will be too great a disappointment to my father if i do not marry mademoiselle danglars.” “marry her then,” said the count, with a significant shrug of the shoulders.
Perplexity: 97021200.0000

Sentence: “yes,” replied morcerf, “but that will plunge my mother into positive grief.” “then do not marry her,” said the count.
Perplexity: 225878960.0000

Sentence: “well, i shall see.
Perplexity: 162410816.0000

Sentence: i will try and think over what is the best thing to be done; you will give me your advice, will you not, and if possible extricate me from my unpleasant position?
Perplexity: 259966752.0000

Sentence: i think, rather than give pain to my dear mother, i would run the risk of offending the count.” monte cristo turned away; he seemed moved by this last remark.
Perplexity: 63205184.0000

Sentence: “ah,” said he to debray, who had thrown himself into an easy-chair at the farthest extremity of the salon, and who held a pencil in his right hand and an account book in his left, “what are you doing there?
Perplexity: 67541816.0000

Sentence: are you making a sketch after poussin?” “oh, no,” was the tranquil response; “i am too fond of art to attempt anything of that sort.
Perplexity: 43604360.0000

Sentence: i am doing a little sum in arithmetic.” “in arithmetic?” “yes; i am calculating—by the way, morcerf, that indirectly concerns you—i am calculating what the house of danglars must have gained by the last rise in haiti bonds; from 206 they have risen to 409 in three days, and the prudent banker had purchased at 206; therefore he must have made 300,000 livres.” “that is not his biggest scoop,” said morcerf; “did he not make a million in spaniards this last year?” “my dear fellow,” said lucien, “here is the count of monte cristo, who will say to you, as the italians do,— “‘denaro e santità, metà della metà.’9 “when they tell me such things, i only shrug my shoulders and say nothing.” “but you were speaking of haitians?” said monte cristo.
Perplexity: 1868917504.0000

Sentence: “ah, haitians,—that is quite another thing!
Perplexity: 121113872.0000

Sentence: haitians are the _écarté_ of french stock-jobbing.
Perplexity: 3566382848.0000

Sentence: we may like bouillotte, delight in whist, be enraptured with boston, and yet grow tired of them all; but we always come back to _écarté_—it is not only a game, it is a _hors-d’œuvre_!
Perplexity: 33063674.0000

Sentence: m. danglars sold yesterday at 405, and pockets 300,000 francs.
Perplexity: 96823760.0000

Sentence: had he but waited till today, the price would have fallen to 205, and instead of gaining 300,000 francs, he would have lost 20 or 25,000.” “and what has caused the sudden fall from 409 to 206?” asked monte cristo.
Perplexity: 40906292.0000

Sentence: “i am profoundly ignorant of all these stock-jobbing intrigues.” “because,” said albert, laughing, “one piece of news follows another, and there is often great dissimilarity between them.” “ah,” said the count, “i see that m. danglars is accustomed to play at gaining or losing 300,000 francs in a day; he must be enormously rich.” “it is not he who plays!” exclaimed lucien; “it is madame danglars; she is indeed daring.” “but you who are a reasonable being, lucien, and who knows how little dependence is to be placed on the news, since you are at the fountain-head, surely you ought to prevent it,” said morcerf, with a smile.
Perplexity: 1183636224.0000

Sentence: “how can i, if her husband fails in controlling her?” asked lucien; “you know the character of the baroness—no one has any influence with her, and she does precisely what she pleases.” “ah, if i were in your place——” said albert.
Perplexity: 335795648.0000

Sentence: “well?” “i would reform her; it would be rendering a service to her future son-in-law.” “how would you set about it?” “ah, that would be easy enough—i would give her a lesson.” “a lesson?” “yes.
Perplexity: 213004256.0000

Sentence: your position as secretary to the minister renders your authority great on the subject of political news; you never open your mouth but the stockbrokers immediately stenograph your words.

Perplexity: 69832440.0000

Sentence: you must resolve upon one simple and single line of conduct, and for a man of your intelligence, this plan is as easy as it is necessary; you must form honorable friendships, and by that means counteract the prejudice which may attach to the obscurity of your former life.” andrea visibly changed countenance.

Sentence: “i would offer myself as your surety and friendly adviser,” said monte cristo, “did i not possess a moral distrust of my best friends, and a sort of inclination to lead others to doubt them too; therefore, in departing from this rule, i should (as the actors say) be playing a part quite out of my line, and should, therefore, run the risk of being hissed, which would be an act of folly.” “however, your excellency,” said andrea, “in consideration of lord wilmore, by whom i was recommended to you——” “yes, certainly,” interrupted monte cristo; “but lord wilmore did not omit to inform me, my dear m. andrea, that the season of your youth was rather a stormy one.

Perplexity: 826662848.0000

Sentence: ah, maximilian, i experienced, at that moment, such remorse for my intention, that, throwing myself at his feet, i exclaimed,—‘forgive me, pray forgive me, my dear grandfather; they may do what they will with me, i will never leave you.’ when i had ceased speaking, he thankfully raised his eyes to heaven, but without uttering a word.
Perplexity: 272228288.0000

Sentence: ah, maximilian, i may have much to suffer, but i feel as if my grandfather’s look at that moment would more than compensate for all.” “dear valentine, you are a perfect angel, and i am sure i do not know what i—sabring right and left among the bedouins—can have done to merit your being revealed to me, unless, indeed, heaven took into consideration the fact that the victims of my sword were infidels.

Sentence: my brother edward, who inherits nothing from his mother, will, therefore, be poor in comparison with me.
Perplexity: 368887296.0000

Sentence: now, if i had taken the veil, all this fortune would have descended to my father, and, in reversion, to his son.” “ah, how strange it seems that such a young and beautiful woman should be so avaricious.” “it is not for herself that she is so, but for her son, and what you regard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when looked at in the light of maternal love.” “but could you not compromise matters, and give up a portion of your fortune to her son?” “how could i make such a proposition, especially to a woman who always professes to be so entirely disinterested?” “valentine, i have always regarded our love in the light of something sacred; consequently, i have covered it with the veil of respect, and hid it in the innermost recesses of my soul.
Perplexity: 144544336.0000

Sentence: no human being, not even my sister, is aware of its existence.
Perplexity: 282651264.0000

Perplexity: 117838936.0000

Sentence: have you never experienced for anyone that sudden and irresistible sympathy which made you feel as if the object of it had been your old and familiar friend, though, in reality, it was the first time you had ever met?
Perplexity: 152511216.0000

Sentence: nay, further, have you never endeavored to recall the time, place, and circumstances of your former intercourse, and failing in this attempt, have almost believed that your spirits must have held converse with each other in some state of being anterior to the present, and that you are only now occupied in a reminiscence of the past?” “yes.” “well, that is precisely the feeling which i experienced when i first saw that extraordinary man.” “extraordinary, did you say?” “yes.” “you have known him for some time, then?” “scarcely longer than eight or ten days.” “and do you call a man your friend whom you have only known for eight or ten days?
Perplexity: 37280996.0000

Sentence: ah, maximilian, i had hoped you set a higher value on the title of friend.” “your logic is most powerful, valentine, but say what you will, i can never renounce the sentiment which has instinctively taken possession of my mind.
Perplexity: 81576712.0000

Sentence: i feel as if it were ordained that this man should be associated with all the good which the future may have in store for me, and sometimes it really seems as if his eye was able to see what was to come, and his hand endowed with the power of directing events according to his own will.” “he must be a prophet, then,” said valentine, smiling.
Perplexity: 496444192.0000

Sentence: “indeed,” said maximilian, “i have often been almost tempted to attribute to him the gift of prophecy; at all events, he has a wonderful power of foretelling any future good.” “ah,” said valentine in a mournful tone, “do let me see this man, maximilian; he may tell me whether i shall ever be loved sufficiently to make amends for all i have suffered.” “my poor girl, you know him already.” “i know him?” “yes; it was he who saved the life of your step-mother and her son.” “the count of monte cristo?” “the same.” “ah,” cried valentine, “he is too much the friend of madame de villefort ever to be mine.” “the friend of madame de villefort!

Perplexity: 266531456.0000

Sentence: courted by my step-mother, who regards him as the epitome of human wisdom; admired by my father, who says he has never before heard such sublime ideas so eloquently expressed; idolized by edward, who, notwithstanding his fear of the count’s large black eyes, runs to meet him the moment he arrives, and opens his hand, in which he is sure to find some delightful present,—m.

Sentence: he meets albert de morcerf in italy—it is to rescue him from the hands of the banditti; he introduces himself to madame danglars—it is that he may give her a royal present; your step-mother and her son pass before his door—it is that his nubian may save them from destruction.

Sentence: if so, depend on it, you will be happy.” “me?” said the young girl, “he never even glances at me; on the contrary, if i accidentally cross his path, he appears rather to avoid me.
Perplexity: 119705592.0000

Sentence: ah, he is not generous, neither does he possess that supernatural penetration which you attribute to him, for if he did, he would have perceived that i was unhappy; and if he had been generous, seeing me sad and solitary, he would have used his influence to my advantage, and since, as you say, he resembles the sun, he would have warmed my heart with one of his life-giving rays.
Perplexity: 190269040.0000

Sentence: you say he loves you, maximilian; how do you know that he does?
Perplexity: 1249680384.0000

Sentence: all would pay deference to an officer like you, with a fierce moustache and a long sabre, but they think they may crush a poor weeping girl with impunity.” “ah, valentine, i assure you you are mistaken.” “if it were otherwise—if he treated me diplomatically—that is to say, like a man who wishes, by some means or other, to obtain a footing in the house, so that he may ultimately gain the power of dictating to its occupants—he would, if it had been but once, have honored me with the smile which you extol so loudly; but no, he saw that i was unhappy, he understood that i could be of no use to him, and therefore paid no attention to me whatever.
Perplexity: 304028736.0000

Sentence: who knows but that, in order to please madame de villefort and my father, he may not persecute me by every means in his power?
Perplexity: 99086408.0000

Sentence: it is not just that he should despise me so, without any reason.
Perplexity: 31975098.0000

Sentence: ah, forgive me,” said valentine, perceiving the effect which her words were producing on maximilian: “i have done wrong, for i have given utterance to thoughts concerning that man which i did not even know existed in my heart.
Perplexity: 64061812.0000

Sentence: i do not deny the influence of which you speak, or that i have not myself experienced it, but with me it has been productive of evil rather than good.” “well, valentine,” said morrel with a sigh, “we will not discuss the matter further.
Perplexity: 67981760.0000

Sentence: has such and such a perfume done anything for me?
Perplexity: 48115256.0000

Perplexity: 451739200.0000

Perplexity: 633031808.0000

Sentence: this may appear to you to be no unusual combination of circumstances; nevertheless, i perceive some hidden plot in the arrangement—something, in fact, more than is apparent on a casual view of the subject.
Perplexity: 320315808.0000

Sentence: i believe that this singular man, who appears to fathom the motives of everyone, has purposely arranged for me to meet m. and madame de villefort, and sometimes, i confess, i have gone so far as to try to read in his eyes whether he was in possession of the secret of our love.” “my good friend,” said valentine, “i should take you for a visionary, and should tremble for your reason, if i were always to hear you talk in a strain similar to this.
Perplexity: 156137440.0000

Perplexity: 117168592.0000

Sentence: my father, who never goes out, has several times been on the point of refusing this invitation; madame de villefort, on the contrary, is burning with the desire of seeing this extraordinary nabob in his own house, therefore, she has with great difficulty prevailed on my father to accompany her.
Perplexity: 2362339072.0000

Sentence: no, no; it is as i have said, maximilian,—there is no one in the world of whom i can ask help but yourself and my grandfather, who is little better than a corpse—no support to cling to but my mother in heaven!” “i see that you are right, logically speaking,” said maximilian; “but the gentle voice which usually has such power over me fails to convince me today.” “i feel the same as regards yourself.” said valentine; “and i own that, if you have no stronger proof to give me——” “i have another,” replied maximilian; “but i fear you will deem it even more absurd than the first.” “so much the worse,” said valentine, smiling.
Perplexity: 757128512.0000

Sentence: “it is, nevertheless, conclusive to my mind.
Perplexity: 115812600.0000

Sentence: my ten years of service have also confirmed my ideas on the subject of sudden inspirations, for i have several times owed my life to a mysterious impulse which directed me to move at once either to the right or to the left, in order to escape the ball which killed the comrade fighting by my side, while it left me unharmed.” “dear maximilian, why not attribute your escape to my constant prayers for your safety?
Perplexity: 373875456.0000

Sentence: when you are away, i no longer pray for myself, but for you.” 30159m “yes, since you have known me,” said morrel, smiling; “but that cannot apply to the time previous to our acquaintance, valentine.” “you are very provoking, and will not give me credit for anything; but let me hear this second proof, which you yourself own to be absurd.” “well, look through this opening, and you will see the beautiful new horse which i rode here.” “ah!
Perplexity: 400695360.0000

Sentence: what a beautiful creature!” cried valentine; “why did you not bring him close to the gate, so that i could talk to him and pat him?” “he is, as you see, a very valuable animal,” said maximilian.

Perplexity: 694845120.0000

Sentence: i asked the price; they told me it was 4,500 francs.
Perplexity: 111320248.0000

Sentence: i was, therefore, obliged to give it up, as you may imagine, but i own i went away with rather a heavy heart, for the horse had looked at me affectionately, had rubbed his head against me and, when i mounted him, had pranced in the most delightful way imaginable, so that i was altogether fascinated with him.
Perplexity: 65346872.0000

Sentence: the same evening some friends of mine visited me,—m.

Perplexity: 241838688.0000

Sentence: as i rode by the count’s house i perceived a light in one of the windows, and fancied i saw the shadow of his figure moving behind the curtain.
Perplexity: 63652936.0000

Sentence: now, valentine, i firmly believe that he knew of my wish to possess this horse, and that he lost expressly to give me the means of procuring him.” “my dear maximilian, you are really too fanciful; you will not love even me long.
Perplexity: 558025664.0000

Sentence: a man who accustoms himself to live in such a world of poetry and imagination must find far too little excitement in a common, every-day sort of attachment such as ours.
Perplexity: 104922328.0000

Sentence: but they are calling me.
Perplexity: 193644656.0000

Sentence: do you hear?” “ah, valentine,” said maximilian, “give me but one finger through this opening in the grating, one finger, the littlest finger of all, that i may have the happiness of kissing it.” “maximilian, we said we would be to each other as two voices, two shadows.” “as you will, valentine.” “shall you be happy if i do what you wish?” “oh, yes!” valentine mounted on a bench, and passed not only her finger but her whole hand through the opening.
Perplexity: 91273448.0000

Sentence: maximilian uttered a cry of delight, and, springing forwards, seized the hand extended towards him, and imprinted on it a fervent and impassioned kiss.
Perplexity: 26968856.0000

Sentence: the little hand was then immediately withdrawn, and the young man saw valentine hurrying towards the house, as though she were almost terrified at her own sensations.
Perplexity: 29111882.0000

Sentence: m. noirtier de villefort we will now relate what was passing in the house of the king’s attorney after the departure of madame danglars and her daughter, and during the time of the conversation between maximilian and valentine, which we have just detailed.
Perplexity: 1196412800.0000

Sentence: m. de villefort entered his father’s room, followed by madame de villefort.
Perplexity: 197937184.0000

Sentence: both of the visitors, after saluting the old man and speaking to barrois, a faithful servant, who had been twenty-five years in his service, took their places on either side of the paralytic.
Perplexity: 187751984.0000

Sentence: m. noirtier was sitting in an armchair, which moved upon casters, in which he was wheeled into the room in the morning, and in the same way drawn out again at night.
Perplexity: 30736432.0000

Sentence: he was placed before a large glass, which reflected the whole apartment, and so, without any attempt to move, which would have been impossible, he could see all who entered the room and everything which was going on around him.
Perplexity: 497214624.0000

Sentence: m. noirtier, although almost as immovable as a corpse, looked at the new-comers with a quick and intelligent expression, perceiving at once, by their ceremonious courtesy, that they were come on business of an unexpected and official character.
Perplexity: 252115520.0000

Sentence: sight and hearing were the only senses remaining, and they, like two solitary sparks, remained to animate the miserable body which seemed fit for nothing but the grave; it was only, however, by means of one of these senses that he could reveal the thoughts and feelings that still occupied his mind, and the look by which he gave expression to his inner life was like the distant gleam of a candle which a traveller sees by night across some desert place, and knows that a living being dwells beyond the silence and obscurity.
Perplexity: 170811280.0000

Sentence: noirtier’s hair was long and white, and flowed over his shoulders; while in his eyes, shaded by thick black lashes, was concentrated, as it often happens with an organ which is used to the exclusion of the others, all the activity, address, force, and intelligence which were formerly diffused over his whole body; and so although the movement of the arm, the sound of the voice, and the agility of the body, were wanting, the speaking eye sufficed for all.
Perplexity: 42690080.0000

Sentence: he commanded with it; it was the medium through which his thanks were conveyed.
Perplexity: 195250176.0000

Sentence: in short, his whole appearance produced on the mind the impression of a corpse with living eyes, and nothing could be more startling than to observe the expression of anger or joy suddenly lighting up these organs, while the rest of the rigid and marble-like features were utterly deprived of the power of participation.
Perplexity: 659841600.0000

Sentence: three persons only could understand this language of the poor paralytic; these were villefort, valentine, and the old servant of whom we have already spoken.
Perplexity: 120733304.0000

Sentence: but as villefort saw his father but seldom, and then only when absolutely obliged, and as he never took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there, all the old man’s happiness was centred in his granddaughter.
Perplexity: 2465400064.0000

Sentence: valentine, by means of her love, her patience, and her devotion, had learned to read in noirtier’s look all the varied feelings which were passing in his mind.
Perplexity: 186382592.0000

Sentence: to this dumb language, which was so unintelligible to others, she answered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her countenance, and in this manner were the conversations sustained between the blooming girl and the helpless invalid, whose body could scarcely be called a living one, but who, nevertheless, possessed a fund of knowledge and penetration, united with a will as powerful as ever although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying its impulses.
Perplexity: 98974584.0000

Sentence: valentine had solved the problem, and was able easily to understand his thoughts, and to convey her own in return, and, through her untiring and devoted assiduity, it was seldom that, in the ordinary transactions of every-day life, she failed to anticipate the wishes of the living, thinking mind, or the wants of the almost inanimate body.
Perplexity: 108301872.0000

Sentence: as to the servant, he had, as we have said, been with his master for five-and-twenty years, therefore he knew all his habits, and it was seldom that noirtier found it necessary to ask for anything, so prompt was he in administering to all the necessities of the invalid.
Perplexity: 798103936.0000

Sentence: villefort did not need the help of either valentine or the domestic in order to carry on with his father the strange conversation which he was about to begin.
Perplexity: 323341376.0000

Sentence: as we have said, he perfectly understood the old man’s vocabulary, and if he did not use it more often, it was only indifference and _ennui_ which prevented him from so doing.
Perplexity: 96733128.0000

Sentence: he therefore allowed valentine to go into the garden, sent away barrois, and after having seated himself at his father’s right hand, while madame de villefort placed herself on the left, he addressed him thus: “i trust you will not be displeased, sir, that valentine has not come with us, or that i dismissed barrois, for our conference will be one which could not with propriety be carried on in the presence of either.
Perplexity: 2923794944.0000

Sentence: madame de villefort and i have a communication to make to you.” noirtier’s face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble, while, on the contrary, villefort’s eye was endeavoring to penetrate into the inmost recesses of the old man’s heart.
Perplexity: 835363008.0000

Sentence: “this communication,” continued the procureur, in that cold and decisive tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion, “will, we are sure, meet with your approbation.” the eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which prevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which were passing in his mind; he listened, nothing more.
Perplexity: 850650560.0000

Sentence: “sir,” resumed villefort, “we are thinking of marrying valentine.” had the old man’s face been moulded in wax it could not have shown less emotion at this news than was now to be traced there.
Perplexity: 310270688.0000

Sentence: “the marriage will take place in less than three months,” said villefort.
Perplexity: 274333056.0000

Sentence: noirtier’s eye still retained its inanimate expression.
Perplexity: 172915776.0000

Sentence: madame de villefort now took her part in the conversation and added: “we thought this news would possess an interest for you, sir, who have always entertained a great affection for valentine; it therefore only now remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she is destined.
Perplexity: 901635136.0000

Sentence: it is one of the most desirable connections which could possibly be formed; he possesses fortune, a high rank in society, and every personal qualification likely to render valentine supremely happy,—his name, moreover, cannot be wholly unknown to you.
Perplexity: 599425920.0000

Sentence: it is m. franz de quesnel, baron d’épinay.” while his wife was speaking, villefort had narrowly watched the old man’s countenance.
Perplexity: 331603200.0000

Sentence: when madame de villefort pronounced the name of franz, the pupil of m. noirtier’s eye began to dilate, and his eyelids trembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the lips of an individual about to speak, and he darted a lightning glance at madame de villefort and his son.
Perplexity: 592962496.0000

Sentence: the procureur, who knew the political hatred which had formerly existed between m. noirtier and the elder d’épinay, well understood the agitation and anger which the announcement had produced; but, feigning not to perceive either, he immediately resumed the narrative begun by his wife.
Perplexity: 677478912.0000

Sentence: “sir,” said he, “you are aware that valentine is about to enter her nineteenth year, which renders it important that she should lose no time in forming a suitable alliance.
Perplexity: 118049728.0000

Sentence: nevertheless, you have not been forgotten in our plans, and we have fully ascertained beforehand that valentine’s future husband will consent, not to live in this house, for that might not be pleasant for the young people, but that you should live with them; so that you and valentine, who are so attached to each other, would not be separated, and you would be able to pursue exactly the same course of life which you have hitherto done, and thus, instead of losing, you will be a gainer by the change, as it will secure to you two children instead of one, to watch over and comfort you.” 30165m noirtier’s look was furious; it was very evident that something desperate was passing in the old man’s mind, for a cry of anger and grief rose in his throat, and not being able to find vent in utterance, appeared almost to choke him, for his face and lips turned quite purple with the struggle.
Perplexity: 308901344.0000

Sentence: villefort quietly opened a window, saying, “it is very warm, and the heat affects m. noirtier.” he then returned to his place, but did not sit down.
Perplexity: 753048384.0000

Sentence: “this marriage,” added madame de villefort, “is quite agreeable to the wishes of m. d’épinay and his family; besides, he had no relations nearer than an uncle and aunt, his mother having died at his birth, and his father having been assassinated in 1815, that is to say, when he was but two years old; it naturally followed that the child was permitted to choose his own pursuits, and he has, therefore, seldom acknowledged any other authority but that of his own will.” “that assassination was a mysterious affair,” said villefort, “and the perpetrators have hitherto escaped detection, although suspicion has fallen on the head of more than one person.” noirtier made such an effort that his lips expanded into a smile.
Perplexity: 804329728.0000

Sentence: “now,” continued villefort, “those to whom the guilt really belongs, by whom the crime was committed, on whose heads the justice of man may probably descend here, and the certain judgment of god hereafter, would rejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing such a peace-offering as valentine on the son of him whose life they so ruthlessly destroyed.” noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion more than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and shattered frame.
Perplexity: 273521632.0000

Perplexity: 6364243968.0000

Sentence: would you like me to send edward to you for a short time?” it had been agreed that the old man should express his approbation by closing his eyes, his refusal by winking them several times, and if he had some desire or feeling to express, he raised them to heaven.
Perplexity: 202644672.0000

Sentence: valentine, with a color still heightened by emotion, entered the room just after her parents had quitted it.

Perplexity: 91614960.0000

Sentence: “dear grandpapa,” cried she, “what has happened?
Perplexity: 728691584.0000

Perplexity: 620676608.0000

Sentence: “who has displeased you?
Perplexity: 232901168.0000

Sentence: is it my father?” “no.” “madame de villefort?” “no.” “me?” the former sign was repeated.
Perplexity: 112331664.0000

Sentence: “are you displeased with me?” cried valentine in astonishment.
Perplexity: 89025024.0000

Sentence: there was no answer, and she continued: “i have not seen you all day.
Perplexity: 285985248.0000

Sentence: what was it then?
Perplexity: 1151667968.0000

Perplexity: 1303354112.0000

Sentence: “ah, you frighten me.
Perplexity: 131470368.0000

Perplexity: 449731776.0000

Sentence: “ah, i know,” said she, lowering her voice and going close to the old man.
Perplexity: 38851300.0000

Sentence: “they have been speaking of my marriage,—have they not?” “yes,” replied the angry look.
Perplexity: 96956816.0000

Sentence: “i understand; you are displeased at the silence i have preserved on the subject.
Perplexity: 25743338.0000

Sentence: the reason of it was, that they had insisted on my keeping the matter a secret, and begged me not to tell you anything of it.
Perplexity: 115290256.0000

Sentence: they did not even acquaint me with their intentions, and i only discovered them by chance, that is why i have been so reserved with you, dear grandpapa.
Perplexity: 68898256.0000

Sentence: pray forgive me.” but there was no look calculated to reassure her; all it seemed to say was, “it is not only your reserve which afflicts me.” “what is it, then?” asked the young girl.
Perplexity: 269136800.0000

Sentence: “perhaps you think i shall abandon you, dear grandpapa, and that i shall forget you when i am married?” “no.” “they told you, then, that m. d’épinay consented to our all living together?” “yes.” “then why are you still vexed and grieved?” the old man’s eyes beamed with an expression of gentle affection.
Perplexity: 188703744.0000

Sentence: “yes, i understand,” said valentine; “it is because you love me.” the old man assented.
Perplexity: 93513176.0000

Sentence: “and you are afraid i shall be unhappy?” “yes.” “you do not like m. franz?” the eyes repeated several times, “no, no, no.” “then you are vexed with the engagement?” “yes.” “well, listen,” said valentine, throwing herself on her knees, and putting her arm round her grandfather’s neck, “i am vexed, too, for i do not love m. franz d’épinay.” an expression of intense joy illumined the old man’s eyes.
Perplexity: 439075008.0000

Sentence: “when i wished to retire into a convent, you remember how angry you were with me?” a tear trembled in the eye of the invalid.
Perplexity: 396386816.0000

Sentence: “well,” continued valentine, “the reason of my proposing it was that i might escape this hateful marriage, which drives me to despair.” noirtier’s breathing came thick and short.
Perplexity: 1072958848.0000

Sentence: “then the idea of this marriage really grieves you too?
Perplexity: 42440108.0000

Sentence: ah, if you could but help me—if we could both together defeat their plan!
Perplexity: 171655232.0000

Sentence: but you are unable to oppose them,—you, whose mind is so quick, and whose will is so firm are nevertheless, as weak and unequal to the contest as i am myself.
Perplexity: 1344891136.0000

Sentence: alas, you, who would have been such a powerful protector to me in the days of your health and strength, can now only sympathize in my joys and sorrows, without being able to take any active part in them.
Perplexity: 1424490112.0000

Sentence: however, this is much, and calls for gratitude and heaven has not taken away all my blessings when it leaves me your sympathy and kindness.” at these words there appeared in noirtier’s eye an expression of such deep meaning that the young girl thought she could read these words there: “you are mistaken; i can still do much for you.” “do you think you can help me, dear grandpapa?” said valentine.
Perplexity: 129370168.0000

Sentence: “yes.” noirtier raised his eyes, it was the sign agreed on between him and valentine when he wanted anything.
Perplexity: 4060395008.0000

Sentence: “what is it you want, dear grandpapa?” said valentine, and she endeavored to recall to mind all the things which he would be likely to need; and as the ideas presented themselves to her mind, she repeated them aloud, then,—finding that all her efforts elicited nothing but a constant _“no,”_—she said, “come, since this plan does not answer, i will have recourse to another.” she then recited all the letters of the alphabet from a down to n. when she arrived at that letter the paralytic made her understand that she had spoken the initial letter of the thing he wanted.
Perplexity: 261436112.0000

Sentence: “ah,” said valentine, “the thing you desire begins with the letter n; it is with n that we have to do, then.

Sentence: well, let me see, what can you want that begins with n?
Perplexity: 343984416.0000

Sentence: na—ne—ni—no——” “yes, yes, yes,” said the old man’s eye.
Perplexity: 1220850304.0000

Sentence: “ah, it is no, then?” “yes.” valentine fetched a dictionary, which she placed on a desk before noirtier; she opened it, and, seeing that the old man’s eye was thoroughly fixed on its pages, she ran her finger quickly up and down the columns.
Perplexity: 170544336.0000

Sentence: during the six years which had passed since noirtier first fell into this sad state, valentine’s powers of invention had been too often put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients for gaining a knowledge of his wishes, and the constant practice had so perfected her in the art that she guessed the old man’s meaning as quickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he wanted.
Perplexity: 495742112.0000

Sentence: at the word _notary_, noirtier made a sign to her to stop.
Perplexity: 2581953280.0000

Sentence: “you would wish a notary to be sent for then?” said valentine.
Perplexity: 91783216.0000

Sentence: “yes.” “shall my father be informed of your wish?” “yes.” “do you wish the notary to be sent for immediately?” “yes.” “then they shall go for him directly, dear grandpapa.
Perplexity: 3525216512.0000

Sentence: is that all you want?” “yes.” valentine rang the bell, and ordered the servant to tell monsieur or madame de villefort that they were requested to come to m. noirtier’s room.
Perplexity: 71649824.0000

Sentence: “are you satisfied now?” inquired valentine.
Perplexity: 1091761280.0000

Sentence: “what do you want me for, sir?” demanded he of the paralytic.
Perplexity: 558382336.0000

Perplexity: 2230397952.0000

Sentence: “yes,” motioned the latter, with a firmness which seemed to declare that with the help of valentine and his old servant, who both knew what his wishes were, he was quite prepared to maintain the contest.
Perplexity: 69582880.0000

Sentence: “do you wish for a notary?” asked villefort.

Sentence: “what do you want with a notary?” again repeated villefort.
Perplexity: 523078976.0000

Sentence: “is it to do us some ill turn?
Perplexity: 699748736.0000

Sentence: do you think it is worth while?” said villefort.
Perplexity: 78127224.0000

Sentence: “still,” said barrois, with the freedom and fidelity of an old servant, “if m. noirtier asks for a notary, i suppose he really wishes for a notary; therefore i shall go at once and fetch one.” barrois acknowledged no master but noirtier, and never allowed his desires in any way to be contradicted.
Perplexity: 3590969344.0000

Sentence: 30171m “yes, i do want a notary,” motioned the old man, shutting his eyes with a look of defiance, which seemed to say, “and i should like to see the person who dares to refuse my request.” “you shall have a notary, as you absolutely wish for one, sir,” said villefort; “but i shall explain to him your state of health, and make excuses for you, for the scene cannot fail of being a most ridiculous one.” “never mind that,” said barrois; “i shall go and fetch a notary, nevertheless.” and the old servant departed triumphantly on his mission.
Perplexity: 283361088.0000

Sentence: the will as soon as barrois had left the room, noirtier looked at valentine with a malicious expression that said many things.
Perplexity: 711658048.0000

Perplexity: 281588000.0000

Sentence: he took a seat, and quietly awaited the arrival of the notary.
Perplexity: 460835264.0000

Sentence: noirtier saw him seat himself with an appearance of perfect indifference, at the same time giving a side look at valentine, which made her understand that she also was to remain in the room.
Perplexity: 427075264.0000

Sentence: three-quarters of an hour after, barrois returned, bringing the notary with him.
Perplexity: 569787648.0000

Sentence: “sir,” said villefort, after the first salutations were over, “you were sent for by m. noirtier, whom you see here.
Perplexity: 361430976.0000

Sentence: all his limbs have become completely paralysed, he has lost his voice also, and we ourselves find much trouble in endeavoring to catch some fragments of his meaning.” noirtier cast an appealing look on valentine, which look was at once so earnest and imperative, that she answered immediately.
Perplexity: 109266696.0000

Sentence: “sir,” said she, “i perfectly understand my grandfather’s meaning at all times.” “that is quite true,” said barrois; “and that is what i told the gentleman as we walked along.” “permit me,” said the notary, turning first to villefort and then to valentine—“permit me to state that the case in question is just one of those in which a public officer like myself cannot proceed to act without thereby incurring a dangerous responsibility.
Perplexity: 695821248.0000

Sentence: the first thing necessary to render an act valid is, that the notary should be thoroughly convinced that he has faithfully interpreted the will and wishes of the person dictating the act.
Perplexity: 98382472.0000

Sentence: now i cannot be sure of the approbation or disapprobation of a client who cannot speak, and as the object of his desire or his repugnance cannot be clearly proved to me, on account of his want of speech, my services here would be quite useless, and cannot be legally exercised.” the notary then prepared to retire.
Perplexity: 197773024.0000

Sentence: an imperceptible smile of triumph was expressed on the lips of the procureur.
Perplexity: 195900368.0000

Perplexity: 328078880.0000

Sentence: “sir,” said she, “the language which i speak with my grandfather may be easily learnt, and i can teach you in a few minutes, to understand it almost as well as i can myself.
Perplexity: 463525696.0000

Sentence: will you tell me what you require, in order to set your conscience quite at ease on the subject?” “in order to render an act valid, i must be certain of the approbation or disapprobation of my client.
Perplexity: 651491584.0000

Sentence: illness of body would not affect the validity of the deed, but sanity of mind is absolutely requisite.” “well, sir, by the help of two signs, with which i will acquaint you presently, you may ascertain with perfect certainty that my grandfather is still in the full possession of all his mental faculties.
Perplexity: 64388148.0000

Perplexity: 409395648.0000

Sentence: “well, sir,” said the young girl, “do you understand now, and is your conscience perfectly at rest on the subject?” but before the notary could answer, villefort had drawn him aside.
Perplexity: 242525120.0000

Sentence: “sir,” said he, “do you suppose for a moment that a man can sustain a physical shock, such as m. noirtier has received, without any detriment to his mental faculties?” “it is not exactly that, sir,” said the notary, “which makes me uneasy, but the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and intentions, so as to be able to get his answers.” “you must see that to be an utter impossibility,” said villefort.
Perplexity: 81160624.0000

Sentence: valentine and the old man heard this conversation, and noirtier fixed his eye so earnestly on valentine that she felt bound to answer to the look.
Perplexity: 386909984.0000

Perplexity: 617061056.0000

Perplexity: 1036213184.0000

Sentence: “yes,” said the procureur, “and i think the will promises to be yet more extraordinary, for i cannot see how it is to be drawn up without the intervention of valentine, and she may, perhaps, be considered as too much interested in its contents to allow of her being a suitable interpreter of the obscure and ill-defined wishes of her grandfather.” “no, no, no,” replied the eye of the paralytic.
Perplexity: 490198368.0000

Sentence: “what?” said villefort, “do you mean to say that valentine is not interested in your will?” “no.” “sir,” said the notary, whose interest had been greatly excited, and who had resolved on publishing far and wide the account of this extraordinary and picturesque scene, “what appeared so impossible to me an hour ago, has now become quite easy and practicable, and this may be a perfectly valid will, provided it be read in the presence of seven witnesses, approved by the testator, and sealed by the notary in the presence of the witnesses.

Sentence: but besides all this, in order that the instrument may not be contested, i am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity, therefore, one of my colleagues will help me, and, contrary to custom, will assist in the dictation of the testament.
Perplexity: 1981635584.0000

Perplexity: 1300977280.0000

Sentence: “it is all as he has said; it is very evident that the mind still retains its full force and vigor.” then, turning towards the paralytic, he said, “you possess, then, 900,000 francs of capital, which, according to the manner in which you have invested it, ought to bring in an income of about 40,000 livres?” “yes.” “to whom do you desire to leave this fortune?” “oh!” said madame de villefort, “there is not much doubt on that subject.
Perplexity: 251536736.0000

Sentence: m. noirtier tenderly loves his granddaughter, mademoiselle de villefort; it is she who has nursed and tended him for six years, and has, by her devoted attention, fully secured the affection, i had almost said the gratitude, of her grandfather, and it is but just that she should reap the fruit of her devotion.” the eye of noirtier clearly showed by its expression that he was not deceived by the false assent given by madame de villefort’s words and manner to the motives which she supposed him to entertain.
Perplexity: 1031691072.0000

Sentence: “is it, then, to mademoiselle valentine de villefort that you leave these 900,000 francs?” demanded the notary, thinking he had only to insert this clause, but waiting first for the assent of noirtier, which it was necessary should be given before all the witnesses of this singular scene.
Perplexity: 165986304.0000

Sentence: valentine, when her name was made the subject of discussion, had stepped back, to escape unpleasant observation; her eyes were cast down, and she was crying.
Perplexity: 544021888.0000

Sentence: the old man looked at her for an instant with an expression of the deepest tenderness, then, turning towards the notary, he significantly winked his eye in token of dissent.
Perplexity: 267415968.0000

Sentence: “what,” said the notary, “do you not intend making mademoiselle valentine de villefort your residuary legatee?” “no.” “you are not making any mistake, are you?” said the notary; “you really mean to declare that such is not your intention?” “no,” repeated noirtier; “no.” valentine raised her head, struck dumb with astonishment.
Perplexity: 257983024.0000

Sentence: it was not so much the conviction that she was disinherited that caused her grief, but her total inability to account for the feelings which had provoked her grandfather to such an act.
Perplexity: 228696784.0000

Sentence: but noirtier looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that she exclaimed: “oh, grandpapa, i see now that it is only your fortune of which you deprive me; you still leave me the love which i have always enjoyed.” “ah, yes, most assuredly,” said the eyes of the paralytic, for he closed them with an expression which valentine could not mistake.
Perplexity: 121106712.0000

Sentence: “thank you, thank you,” murmured she.
Perplexity: 273033248.0000

Sentence: the old man’s declaration that valentine was not the destined inheritor of his fortune had excited the hopes of madame de villefort; she gradually approached the invalid, and said: “then, doubtless, dear m. noirtier, you intend leaving your fortune to your grandson, edward de villefort?” the winking of the eyes which answered this speech was most decided and terrible, and expressed a feeling almost amounting to hatred.
Perplexity: 376028800.0000

Sentence: “no?” said the notary; “then, perhaps, it is to your son, m. de villefort?” “no.” the two notaries looked at each other in mute astonishment and inquiry as to what were the real intentions of the testator.
Perplexity: 1898605696.0000

Sentence: villefort and his wife both grew red, one from shame, the other from anger.
Perplexity: 105252856.0000

Sentence: “what have we all done, then, dear grandpapa?” said valentine; “you no longer seem to love any of us?” the old man’s eyes passed rapidly from villefort and his wife, and rested on valentine with a look of unutterable fondness.
Perplexity: 409395648.0000

Sentence: “well,” said she; “if you love me, grandpapa, try and bring that love to bear upon your actions at this present moment.
Perplexity: 242525120.0000

Sentence: you know me well enough to be quite sure that i have never thought of your fortune; besides, they say i am already rich in right of my mother—too rich, even.
Perplexity: 523078976.0000

Sentence: explain yourself, then.” noirtier fixed his intelligent eyes on valentine’s hand.
Perplexity: 340729280.0000

Sentence: “my hand?” said she.
Perplexity: 3317678336.0000

Sentence: “yes.” “her hand!” exclaimed everyone.
Perplexity: 120541864.0000

Sentence: “oh, gentlemen, you see it is all useless, and that my father’s mind is really impaired,” said villefort.
Perplexity: 4147909120.0000

Sentence: “ah,” cried valentine suddenly, “i understand.
Perplexity: 28168186.0000

Sentence: it is my marriage you mean, is it not, dear grandpapa?” “yes, yes, yes,” signed the paralytic, casting on valentine a look of joyful gratitude for having guessed his meaning.
Perplexity: 6963300864.0000

Sentence: 30179m “you are angry with us all on account of this marriage, are you not?” “yes?” “really, this is too absurd,” said villefort.
Perplexity: 171191264.0000

Sentence: “excuse me, sir,” replied the notary; “on the contrary, the meaning of m. noirtier is quite evident to me, and i can quite easily connect the train of ideas passing in his mind.” “you do not wish me to marry m. franz d’épinay?” observed valentine.
Perplexity: 52346392.0000

Sentence: “i do not wish it,” said the eye of her grandfather.
Perplexity: 1042928896.0000

Sentence: “and you disinherit your granddaughter,” continued the notary, “because she has contracted an engagement contrary to your wishes?” “yes.” “so that, but for this marriage, she would have been your heir?” “yes.” there was a profound silence.
Perplexity: 187224880.0000

Sentence: the two notaries were holding a consultation as to the best means of proceeding with the affair.
Perplexity: 417024576.0000

Sentence: valentine was looking at her grandfather with a smile of intense gratitude, and villefort was biting his lips with vexation, while madame de villefort could not succeed in repressing an inward feeling of joy, which, in spite of herself, appeared in her whole countenance.
Perplexity: 508437120.0000

Sentence: “but,” said villefort, who was the first to break the silence, “i consider that i am the best judge of the propriety of the marriage in question.
Perplexity: 280792608.0000

Sentence: i am the only person possessing the right to dispose of my daughter’s hand.
Perplexity: 216472496.0000

Sentence: it is my wish that she should marry m. franz d’épinay—and she shall marry him.” valentine sank weeping into a chair.
Perplexity: 867333888.0000

Sentence: “sir,” said the notary, “how do you intend disposing of your fortune in case mademoiselle de villefort still determines on marrying m. franz?” the old man gave no answer.
Perplexity: 616676288.0000

Sentence: “you will, of course, dispose of it in some way or other?” “yes.” “in favor of some member of your family?” “no.” “do you intend devoting it to charitable purposes, then?” pursued the notary.
Perplexity: 94616208.0000

Sentence: “yes.” “but,” said the notary, “you are aware that the law does not allow a son to be entirely deprived of his patrimony?” “yes.” “you only intend, then, to dispose of that part of your fortune which the law allows you to subtract from the inheritance of your son?” noirtier made no answer.
Perplexity: 168027808.0000

Sentence: “do you still wish to dispose of all?” “yes.” “but they will contest the will after your death?” “no.” “my father knows me,” replied villefort; “he is quite sure that his wishes will be held sacred by me; besides, he understands that in my position i cannot plead against the poor.” the eye of noirtier beamed with triumph.
Perplexity: 876151168.0000

Sentence: “what do you decide on, sir?” asked the notary of villefort.
Perplexity: 734591744.0000

Sentence: “nothing, sir; it is a resolution which my father has taken and i know he never alters his mind.
Perplexity: 673059904.0000

Sentence: i am quite resigned.
Perplexity: 527685504.0000

Sentence: these 900,000 francs will go out of the family in order to enrich some hospital; but it is ridiculous thus to yield to the caprices of an old man, and i shall, therefore, act according to my conscience.” having said this, villefort quitted the room with his wife, leaving his father at liberty to do as he pleased.
Perplexity: 186401792.0000

Sentence: the same day the will was made, the witnesses were brought, it was approved by the old man, sealed in the presence of all and given in charge to m. deschamps, the family notary.
Perplexity: 53590208.0000

Sentence: the telegraph m. and madame de villefort found on their return that the count of monte cristo, who had come to visit them in their absence, had been ushered into the drawing-room, and was still awaiting them there.
Perplexity: 738422528.0000

Sentence: madame de villefort, who had not yet sufficiently recovered from her late emotion to allow of her entertaining visitors so immediately, retired to her bedroom, while the procureur, who could better depend upon himself, proceeded at once to the salon.
Perplexity: 185471216.0000

Sentence: although m. de villefort flattered himself that, to all outward view, he had completely masked the feelings which were passing in his mind, he did not know that the cloud was still lowering on his brow, so much so that the count, whose smile was radiant, immediately noticed his sombre and thoughtful air.
Perplexity: 435905792.0000

Sentence: “_ma foi!_” said monte cristo, after the first compliments were over, “what is the matter with you, m. de villefort?
Perplexity: 361931136.0000

Sentence: have i arrived at the moment when you were drawing up an indictment for a capital crime?” villefort tried to smile.
Perplexity: 13685483520.0000

Sentence: “no, count,” he replied, “i am the only victim in this case.
Perplexity: 255537328.0000

Sentence: it is i who lose my cause, and it is ill-luck, obstinacy, and folly which have caused it to be decided against me.” “to what do you refer?” said monte cristo with well-feigned interest.
Perplexity: 16136978432.0000

Sentence: “have you really met with some great misfortune?” “oh, no, monsieur,” said villefort with a bitter smile; “it is only a loss of money which i have sustained—nothing worth mentioning, i assure you.” “true,” said monte cristo, “the loss of a sum of money becomes almost immaterial with a fortune such as you possess, and to one of your philosophic spirit.” “it is not so much the loss of the money that vexes me,” said villefort, “though, after all, 900,000 francs are worth regretting; but i am the more annoyed with this fate, chance, or whatever you please to call the power which has destroyed my hopes and my fortune, and may blast the prospects of my child also, as it is all occasioned by an old man relapsed into second childhood.” 30183m “what do you say?” said the count; “900,000 francs?
Perplexity: 923421824.0000

Sentence: it is indeed a sum which might be regretted even by a philosopher.
Perplexity: 3588586496.0000

Sentence: and who is the cause of all this annoyance?” “my father, as i told you.” “m.
Perplexity: 239295360.0000

Sentence: noirtier?
Perplexity: 98237336.0000

Sentence: but i thought you told me he had become entirely paralyzed, and that all his faculties were completely destroyed?” “yes, his bodily faculties, for he can neither move nor speak, nevertheless he thinks, acts, and wills in the manner i have described.
Perplexity: 108254160.0000

Sentence: i left him about five minutes ago, and he is now occupied in dictating his will to two notaries.” “but to do this he must have spoken?” “he has done better than that—he has made himself understood.” “how was such a thing possible?” “by the help of his eyes, which are still full of life, and, as you perceive, possess the power of inflicting mortal injury.” “my dear,” said madame de villefort, who had just entered the room, “perhaps you exaggerate the evil.” “good-morning, madame,” said the count, bowing.
Perplexity: 196570336.0000

Sentence: madame de villefort acknowledged the salutation with one of her most gracious smiles.
Perplexity: 261989696.0000

Sentence: “what is this that m. de villefort has been telling me?” demanded monte cristo “and what incomprehensible misfortune——” “incomprehensible is the word!” interrupted the procureur, shrugging his shoulders.
Perplexity: 349650048.0000

Sentence: “it is an old man’s caprice!” “and is there no means of making him revoke his decision?” “yes,” said madame de villefort; “and it is still entirely in the power of my husband to cause the will, which is now in prejudice of valentine, to be altered in her favor.” the count, who perceived that m. and madame de villefort were beginning to speak in parables, appeared to pay no attention to the conversation, and feigned to be busily engaged in watching edward, who was mischievously pouring some ink into the bird’s water-glass.
Perplexity: 244414672.0000

Sentence: “my dear,” said villefort, in answer to his wife, “you know i have never been accustomed to play the patriarch in my family, nor have i ever considered that the fate of a universe was to be decided by my nod.
Perplexity: 844124160.0000

Sentence: nevertheless, it is necessary that my will should be respected in my family, and that the folly of an old man and the caprice of a child should not be allowed to overturn a project which i have entertained for so many years.
Perplexity: 399175072.0000

Sentence: the baron d’épinay was my friend, as you know, and an alliance with his son is the most suitable thing that could possibly be arranged.” “do you think,” said madame de villefort, “that valentine is in league with him?
Perplexity: 78270408.0000

Sentence: she has always been opposed to this marriage, and i should not be at all surprised if what we have just seen and heard is nothing but the execution of a plan concerted between them.” “madame,” said villefort, “believe me, a fortune of 900,000 francs is not so easily renounced.” “she could, nevertheless, make up her mind to renounce the world, sir, since it is only about a year ago that she herself proposed entering a convent.” “never mind,” replied villefort; “i say that this marriage _shall_ be consummated.” “notwithstanding your father’s wishes to the contrary?” said madame de villefort, selecting a new point of attack.
Perplexity: 390370944.0000

Sentence: “that is a serious thing.” monte cristo, who pretended not to be listening, heard however, every word that was said.
Perplexity: 26317354.0000

Sentence: 30185m “madame,” replied villefort “i can truly say that i have always entertained a high respect for my father, because, to the natural feeling of relationship was added the consciousness of his moral superiority.
Perplexity: 22253434.0000

Sentence: the name of father is sacred in two senses; he should be reverenced as the author of our being and as a master whom we ought to obey.
Perplexity: 1335866496.0000

Sentence: but, under the present circumstances, i am justified in doubting the wisdom of an old man who, because he hated the father, vents his anger on the son.
Perplexity: 123839464.0000

Sentence: it would be ridiculous in me to regulate my conduct by such caprices.
Perplexity: 20848026.0000

Sentence: i shall still continue to preserve the same respect toward m. noirtier; i will suffer, without complaint, the pecuniary deprivation to which he has subjected me; but i shall remain firm in my determination, and the world shall see which party has reason on his side.
Perplexity: 579528192.0000

Sentence: consequently i shall marry my daughter to the baron franz d’épinay, because i consider it would be a proper and eligible match for her to make, and, in short, because i choose to bestow my daughter’s hand on whomever i please.” “what?” said the count, the approbation of whose eye villefort had frequently solicited during this speech.
Perplexity: 255833360.0000

Sentence: “what?
Perplexity: 1172920832.0000

Sentence: do you say that m. noirtier disinherits mademoiselle de villefort because she is going to marry m. le baron franz d’épinay?” “yes, sir, that is the reason,” said villefort, shrugging his shoulders.
Perplexity: 307571488.0000

Sentence: “the apparent reason, at least,” said madame de villefort.
Perplexity: 453823072.0000

Sentence: “the _real_ reason, madame, i can assure you; i know my father.” “but i want to know in what way m. d’épinay can have displeased your father more than any other person?” “i believe i know m. franz d’épinay,” said the count; “is he not the son of general de quesnel, who was created baron d’épinay by charles x.?” “the same,” said villefort.
Perplexity: 307099008.0000

Sentence: “well, but he is a charming young man, according to my ideas.” “he is, which makes me believe that it is only an excuse of m. noirtier to prevent his granddaughter marrying; old men are always so selfish in their affection,” said madame de villefort.
Perplexity: 386932128.0000

Sentence: “but,” said monte cristo “do you not know any cause for this hatred?” “ah, _ma foi!_ who is to know?” “perhaps it is some political difference?” “my father and the baron d’épinay lived in the stormy times of which i only saw the ending,” said villefort.
Perplexity: 828465472.0000

Sentence: “was not your father a bonapartist?” asked monte cristo; “i think i remember that you told me something of that kind.” “my father has been a jacobin more than anything else,” said villefort, carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence; “and the senator’s robe, which napoleon cast on his shoulders, only served to disguise the old man without in any degree changing him.
Perplexity: 1500345984.0000

Sentence: when my father conspired, it was not for the emperor, it was against the bourbons; for m. noirtier possessed this peculiarity, he never projected any utopian schemes which could never be realized, but strove for possibilities, and he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of the mountain,—theories that never shrank from any means that were deemed necessary to bring about the desired result.” “well,” said monte cristo, “it is just as i thought; it was politics which brought noirtier and m. d’épinay into personal contact.
Perplexity: 145344960.0000

Sentence: although general d’épinay served under napoleon, did he not still retain royalist sentiments?
Perplexity: 172778288.0000

Sentence: and was he not the person who was assassinated one evening on leaving a bonapartist meeting to which he had been invited on the supposition that he favored the cause of the emperor?” villefort looked at the count almost with terror.
Perplexity: 60747672.0000

Sentence: “am i mistaken, then?” said monte cristo.
Perplexity: 1008116928.0000

Sentence: “no, sir, the facts were precisely what you have stated,” said madame de villefort; “and it was to prevent the renewal of old feuds that m. de villefort formed the idea of uniting in the bonds of affection the two children of these inveterate enemies.” “it was a sublime and charitable thought,” said monte cristo, “and the whole world should applaud it.
Perplexity: 513936128.0000

Sentence: it would be noble to see mademoiselle noirtier de villefort assuming the title of madame franz d’épinay.” villefort shuddered and looked at monte cristo as if he wished to read in his countenance the real feelings which had dictated the words he had just uttered.
Perplexity: 1319311360.0000

Sentence: but the count completely baffled the procureur, and prevented him from discovering anything beneath the never-varying smile he was so constantly in the habit of assuming.
Perplexity: 106939504.0000

Sentence: “although,” said villefort, “it will be a serious thing for valentine to lose her grandfather’s fortune, i do not think that m. d’épinay will be frightened at this pecuniary loss.
Perplexity: 88520288.0000

Sentence: he will, perhaps, hold me in greater esteem than the money itself, seeing that i sacrifice everything in order to keep my word with him.
Perplexity: 132553832.0000

Sentence: besides, he knows that valentine is rich in right of her mother, and that she will, in all probability, inherit the fortune of m. and madame de saint-méran, her mother’s parents, who both love her tenderly.” “and who are fully as well worth loving and tending as m. noirtier,” said madame de villefort; “besides, they are to come to paris in about a month, and valentine, after the affront she has received, need not consider it necessary to continue to bury herself alive by being shut up with m. noirtier.” the count listened with satisfaction to this tale of wounded self-love and defeated ambition.
Perplexity: 28773488.0000

Sentence: “but it seems to me,” said monte cristo, “and i must begin by asking your pardon for what i am about to say, that if m. noirtier disinherits mademoiselle de villefort because she is going to marry a man whose father he detested, he cannot have the same cause of complaint against this dear edward.” “true,” said madame de villefort, with an intonation of voice which it is impossible to describe; “is it not unjust—shamefully unjust?
Perplexity: 537087296.0000

Sentence: poor edward is as much m. noirtier’s grandchild as valentine, and yet, if she had not been going to marry m. franz, m. noirtier would have left her all his money; and supposing valentine to be disinherited by her grandfather, she will still be three times richer than he.” the count listened and said no more.
Perplexity: 217262144.0000

Sentence: “count,” said villefort, “we will not entertain you any longer with our family misfortunes.
Perplexity: 1181076736.0000

Sentence: it is true that my patrimony will go to endow charitable institutions, and my father will have deprived me of my lawful inheritance without any reason for doing so, but i shall have the satisfaction of knowing that i have acted like a man of sense and feeling.
Perplexity: 4691070464.0000

Sentence: m. d’épinay, to whom i had promised the interest of this sum, shall receive it, even if i endure the most cruel privations.” “however,” said madame de villefort, returning to the one idea which incessantly occupied her mind, “perhaps it would be better to explain this unlucky affair to m. d’épinay, in order to give him the opportunity of himself renouncing his claim to the hand of mademoiselle de villefort.” “ah, that would be a great pity,” said villefort.
Perplexity: 592087680.0000

Sentence: “a great pity,” said monte cristo.
Perplexity: 128295840.0000

Sentence: “undoubtedly,” said villefort, moderating the tones of his voice, “a marriage once concerted and then broken off, throws a sort of discredit on a young lady; then again, the old reports, which i was so anxious to put an end to, will instantly gain ground.
Perplexity: 126870816.0000

Sentence: no, it will all go well; m. d’épinay, if he is an honorable man, will consider himself more than ever pledged to mademoiselle de villefort, unless he were actuated by a decided feeling of avarice, but that is impossible.” “i agree with m. de villefort,” said monte cristo, fixing his eyes on madame de villefort; “and if i were sufficiently intimate with him to allow of giving my advice, i would persuade him, since i have been told m. d’épinay is coming back, to settle this affair at once beyond all possibility of revocation.
Perplexity: 84234808.0000

Sentence: i will answer for the success of a project which will reflect so much honor on m. de villefort.” the procureur arose, delighted with the proposition, but his wife slightly changed color.
Perplexity: 186070016.0000

Sentence: “well, that is all that i wanted, and i will be guided by a counsellor such as you are,” said he, extending his hand to monte cristo.
Perplexity: 1935103616.0000

Sentence: “therefore let everyone here look upon what has passed today as if it had not happened, and as though we had never thought of such a thing as a change in our original plans.” “sir,” said the count, “the world, unjust as it is, will be pleased with your resolution; your friends will be proud of you, and m. d’épinay, even if he took mademoiselle de villefort without any dowry, which he will not do, would be delighted with the idea of entering a family which could make such sacrifices in order to keep a promise and fulfil a duty.” at the conclusion of these words, the count rose to depart.
Perplexity: 144027216.0000

Sentence: “are you going to leave us, count?” said madame de villefort.
Perplexity: 1728574848.0000

Sentence: “i am sorry to say i must do so, madame, i only came to remind you of your promise for saturday.” “did you fear that we should forget it?” “you are very good, madame, but m. de villefort has so many important and urgent occupations.” “my husband has given me his word, sir,” said madame de villefort; “you have just seen him resolve to keep it when he has everything to lose, and surely there is more reason for his doing so where he has everything to gain.” “and,” said villefort, “is it at your house in the champs-élysées that you receive your visitors?” “no,” said monte cristo, “which is precisely the reason which renders your kindness more meritorious,—it is in the country.” “in the country?” “yes.” “where is it, then?
Perplexity: 67576088.0000

Sentence: near paris, is it not?” “very near, only half a league from the barriers,—it is at auteuil.” “at auteuil?” said villefort; “true, madame de villefort told me you lived at auteuil, since it was to your house that she was taken.
Perplexity: 73784488.0000

Sentence: and in what part of auteuil do you reside?” “rue de la fontaine.” “rue de la fontaine!” exclaimed villefort in an agitated tone; “at what number?” “no.
Perplexity: 278346144.0000

Sentence: 28.” “then,” cried villefort, “was it you who bought m. de saint-méran’s house!” “did it belong to m. de saint-méran?” demanded monte cristo.
Perplexity: 120944896.0000

Sentence: “yes,” replied madame de villefort; “and, would you believe it, count——” “believe what?” “you think this house pretty, do you not?” “i think it charming.” “well, my husband would never live in it.” “indeed?” returned monte cristo, “that is a prejudice on your part, m. de villefort, for which i am quite at a loss to account.” “i do not like auteuil, sir,” said the procureur, making an evident effort to appear calm.
Perplexity: 43241436.0000

Sentence: “but i hope you will not carry your antipathy so far as to deprive me of the pleasure of your company, sir,” said monte cristo.
Perplexity: 635403968.0000

Sentence: “no, count,—i hope—i assure you i shall do my best,” stammered villefort.
Perplexity: 335031776.0000

Sentence: “oh,” said monte cristo, “i allow of no excuse.
Perplexity: 432068320.0000

Sentence: on saturday, at six o’clock.
Perplexity: 1621852416.0000

Sentence: i shall be expecting you, and if you fail to come, i shall think—for how do i know to the contrary?—that this house, which has remained uninhabited for twenty years, must have some gloomy tradition or dreadful legend connected with it.” “i will come, count,—i will be sure to come,” said villefort eagerly.

Sentence: “yes, a telegraph.
Perplexity: 1834923904.0000

Sentence: i had often seen one placed at the end of a road on a hillock, and in the light of the sun its black arms, bending in every direction, always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle, and i assure you it was never without emotion that i gazed on it, for i could not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should be made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the distance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting at a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the opposite extremity, and all this effected by a simple act of volition on the part of the sender of the message.

Perplexity: 216604256.0000

Perplexity: 19765452.0000

Sentence: leaving the village of linas, without stopping at the telegraph, which flourished its great bony arms as he passed, the count reached the tower of montlhéry, situated, as everyone knows, upon the highest point of the plain of that name.
Perplexity: 114015128.0000

Sentence: at the foot of the hill the count dismounted and began to ascend by a little winding path, about eighteen inches wide; when he reached the summit he found himself stopped by a hedge, upon which green fruit had succeeded to red and white flowers.

Perplexity: 431532160.0000

Sentence: no one would have thought in looking at this old, weather-beaten, floral-decked tower (which might be likened to an elderly dame dressed up to receive her grandchildren at a birthday feast) that it would have been capable of telling strange things, if,—in addition to the menacing ears which the proverb says all walls are provided with,—it had also a voice.

Perplexity: 995016000.0000

Sentence: and yet it was not because the damp had been excluded from the garden; the earth, black as soot, the thick foliage of the trees betrayed its presence; besides, had natural humidity been wanting, it could have been immediately supplied by artificial means, thanks to a tank of water, sunk in one of the corners of the garden, and upon which were stationed a frog and a toad, who, from antipathy, no doubt, always remained on the two opposite sides of the basin.
Perplexity: 18614652928.0000

Sentence: there was not a blade of grass to be seen in the paths, or a weed in the flower-beds; no fine lady ever trained and watered her geraniums, her cacti, and her rhododendrons, in her porcelain _jardinière_ with more pains than this hitherto unseen gardener bestowed upon his little enclosure.

Perplexity: 18085152.0000

Sentence: but, sir, once more i beg pardon; perhaps you are an officer that i am detaining here.” and he glanced timidly at the count’s blue coat.
Perplexity: 66482620.0000

Sentence: 30197m “calm yourself, my friend,” said the count, with the smile which he made at will either terrible or benevolent, and which now expressed only the kindliest feeling; “i am not an inspector, but a traveller, brought here by a curiosity he half repents of, since he causes you to lose your time.” “ah, my time is not valuable,” replied the man with a melancholy smile.
Perplexity: 139614608.0000

Sentence: “still it belongs to government, and i ought not to waste it; but, having received the signal that i might rest for an hour” (here he glanced at the sun-dial, for there was everything in the enclosure of montlhéry, even a sun-dial), “and having ten minutes before me, and my strawberries being ripe, when a day longer—by-the-by, sir, do you think dormice eat them?” “indeed, i should think not,” replied monte cristo; “dormice are bad neighbors for us who do not eat them preserved, as the romans did.” “what?
Perplexity: 445969888.0000

Perplexity: 1247049344.0000

Sentence: ah, those gentlemen never choose the worst morsels; like mère simon’s son, who has not chosen the worst strawberries.
Perplexity: 36595640.0000

Sentence: but this year,” continued the horticulturist, “i’ll take care it shall not happen, even if i should be forced to sit by the whole night to watch when the strawberries are ripe.” monte cristo had seen enough.
Perplexity: 257514528.0000

Perplexity: 1758027648.0000

Perplexity: 94795392.0000

Perplexity: 1030711616.0000

Sentence: i am a machine then, and nothing else, and so long as i work, nothing more is required of me.” “is it possible,” said monte cristo to himself, “that i can have met with a man that has no ambition?
Perplexity: 344539936.0000

Sentence: that would spoil my plans.” “sir,” said the gardener, glancing at the sun-dial, “the ten minutes are almost up; i must return to my post.
Perplexity: 171494544.0000

Sentence: will you go up with me?” “i follow you.” monte cristo entered the tower, which was divided into three stories.
Perplexity: 1362297344.0000

Sentence: the tower contained implements, such as spades, rakes, watering-pots, hung against the wall; this was all the furniture.
Perplexity: 376968128.0000

Sentence: the second was the man’s conventional abode, or rather sleeping-place; it contained a few poor articles of household furniture—a bed, a table, two chairs, a stone pitcher—and some dry herbs, hung up to the ceiling, which the count recognized as sweet peas, and of which the good man was preserving the seeds; he had labelled them with as much care as if he had been master botanist in the jardin des plantes.

Perplexity: 3192722944.0000

Sentence: at first my neck was cramped with looking at it, but at the end of a year i became used to it; and then we have our hours of recreation, and our holidays.” “holidays?” “yes.” “when?” “when we have a fog.” “ah, to be sure.” “those are indeed holidays to me; i go into the garden, i plant, i prune, i trim, i kill the insects all day long.” “how long have you been here?” “ten years, and five as a supernumerary make fifteen.” “you are——” “fifty-five years old.” “how long must you have served to claim the pension?” “oh, sir, twenty-five years.” “and how much is the pension?” “a hundred crowns.” “poor humanity!” murmured monte cristo.

Perplexity: 296741888.0000

Sentence: “you will see,” said the man proudly; “in five minutes he will speak.” “i have, then, five minutes,” said monte cristo to himself; “it is more time than i require.
Perplexity: 674212416.0000

Sentence: my dear sir, will you allow me to ask you a question?” “what is it, sir?” “you are fond of gardening?” “passionately.” “and you would be pleased to have, instead of this terrace of twenty feet, an enclosure of two acres?” “sir, i should make a terrestrial paradise of it.” “you live badly on your thousand francs?” “badly enough; but yet i do live.” “yes; but you have a wretchedly small garden.” “true, the garden is not large.” “and, then, such as it is, it is filled with dormice, who eat everything.” “ah, they are my scourges.” “tell me, should you have the misfortune to turn your head while your right-hand correspondent was telegraphing——” “i should not see him.” “then what would happen?” “i could not repeat the signals.” “and then?” “not having repeated them, through negligence, i should be fined.” “how much?” “a hundred francs.” “the tenth of your income—that would be fine work.” “ah!” said the man.

Sentence: do you not know these bits of paper?” “bank-notes!” “exactly; there are fifteen of them.” “and whose are they?” “yours, if you like.” “mine?” exclaimed the man, half-suffocated.
Perplexity: 523078976.0000

Sentence: “yes; yours—your own property.” “sir, my right-hand correspondent is signalling.” “let him signal.” “sir, you have distracted me; i shall be fined.” “that will cost you a hundred francs; you see it is your interest to take my bank-notes.” “sir, my right-hand correspondent redoubles his signals; he is impatient.” “never mind—take these;” and the count placed the packet in the man’s hands.
Perplexity: 263941792.0000

Sentence: “now this is not all,” he said; “you cannot live upon your fifteen thousand francs.” “i shall still have my place.” “no, you will lose it, for you are going to alter your correspondent’s message.” “oh, sir, what are you proposing?” “a jest.” “sir, unless you force me——” “i think i can effectually force you;” and monte cristo drew another packet from his pocket.

Perplexity: 2743368704.0000

Sentence: “what am i to do?” “nothing very difficult.” “but what is it?” “to repeat these signs.” monte cristo took a paper from his pocket, upon which were drawn three signs, with numbers to indicate the order in which they were to be worked.
Perplexity: 250883168.0000

Sentence: “there, you see it will not take long.” “yes; but——” “do this, and you will have nectarines and all the rest.” the shot told; red with fever, while the large drops fell from his brow, the man executed, one after the other, the three signs given by the count, in spite of the frightful contortions of the right-hand correspondent, who, not understanding the change, began to think the gardener had gone mad.

Sentence: their agony formed part of their merit—if they were not seen alive, they were despised when dead.” “yes,” said debray, “but then ostia is only a few leagues from rome.” “true,” said monte cristo; “but what would be the use of living eighteen hundred years after lucullus, if we can do no better than he could?” the two cavalcanti opened their enormous eyes, but had the good sense not to say anything.
Perplexity: 1320305664.0000

Perplexity: 183411120.0000

Perplexity: 141718848.0000

Perplexity: 8172738560.0000

Perplexity: 182575200.0000

Perplexity: 602438080.0000

Sentence: “come this way, gentlemen; come, m. villefort, for a declaration to be available, should be made before the competent authorities.” he then took villefort’s arm, and, at the same time, holding that of madame danglars under his own, he dragged the procureur to the plantain-tree, where the shade was thickest.

Perplexity: 341420160.0000

Perplexity: 353543648.0000

Sentence: then he had been seized upon by danglars, who, with a rapid glance at the stiff-necked old major and his modest son, and taking into consideration the hospitality of the count, made up his mind that he was in the society of some nabob come to paris to finish the worldly education of his heir.
Perplexity: 2751973888.0000

Sentence: he contemplated with unspeakable delight the large diamond which shone on the major’s little finger; for the major, like a prudent man, in case of any accident happening to his bank-notes, had immediately converted them into an available asset.

Sentence: then, after dinner, on the pretext of business, he questioned the father and son upon their mode of living; and the father and son, previously informed that it was through danglars the one was to receive his 48,000 francs and the other 50,000 livres annually, were so full of affability that they would have shaken hands even with the banker’s servants, so much did their gratitude need an object to expend itself upon.
Perplexity: 261197856.0000

Perplexity: 132382528.0000

Perplexity: 439529984.0000

Sentence: then he had eaten some without saying a word more; danglars, therefore, concluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the illustrious descendant of the cavalcanti, who most likely in lucca fed upon trout brought from switzerland, and lobsters sent from england, by the same means used by the count to bring the lampreys from lake fusaro, and the sterlet from the volga.
Perplexity: 83110336.0000

Sentence: thus it was with much politeness of manner that he heard cavalcanti pronounce these words: “tomorrow, sir, i shall have the honor of waiting upon you on business.” “and i, sir,” said danglars, “shall be most happy to receive you.” upon which he offered to take cavalcanti in his carriage to the hôtel des princes, if it would not be depriving him of the company of his son.
Perplexity: 36208008.0000

Perplexity: 1091771648.0000

Sentence: the major seated himself, therefore, by the side of danglars, who was more and more charmed with the ideas of order and economy which ruled this man, and yet who, being able to allow his son 60,000 francs a year, might be supposed to possess a fortune of 500,000 or 600,000 livres.
Perplexity: 211131088.0000

Sentence: as for andrea, he began, by way of showing off, to scold his groom, who, instead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house, had taken it to the outer door, thus giving him the trouble of walking thirty steps to reach it.
Perplexity: 133435064.0000

Perplexity: 140379904.0000

Sentence: a red handkerchief encircled his gray head; torn and filthy garments covered his large bony limbs, which seemed as though, like those of a skeleton, they would rattle as he walked; and the hand with which he leaned upon the young man’s shoulder, and which was the first thing andrea saw, seemed of gigantic size.
Perplexity: 605094848.0000

Sentence: 30229m did the young man recognize that face by the light of the lantern in his tilbury, or was he merely struck with the horrible appearance of his interrogator?

Sentence: we cannot say; but only relate the fact that he shuddered and stepped back suddenly.
Perplexity: 352509376.0000

Sentence: “what do you want of me?” he asked.
Perplexity: 60677500.0000

Sentence: “pardon me, my friend, if i disturb you,” said the man with the red handkerchief, “but i want to speak to you.” “you have no right to beg at night,” said the groom, endeavoring to rid his master of the troublesome intruder.
Perplexity: 150130704.0000

Sentence: “i am not begging, my fine fellow,” said the unknown to the servant, with so ironical an expression of the eye, and so frightful a smile, that he withdrew; “i only wish to say two or three words to your master, who gave me a commission to execute about a fortnight ago.” “come,” said andrea, with sufficient nerve for his servant not to perceive his agitation, “what do you want?
Perplexity: 163569456.0000

Sentence: speak quickly, friend.” the man said, in a low voice: “i wish—i wish you to spare me the walk back to paris.
Perplexity: 413067200.0000

Sentence: “tell me,” he said—“tell me what you want?” “well, then, i want you to take me up in your fine carriage, and carry me back.” andrea turned pale, but said nothing.
Perplexity: 3767253504.0000

Sentence: “yes,” said the man, thrusting his hands into his pockets, and looking impudently at the youth; “i have taken the whim into my head; do you understand, master benedetto?” at this name, no doubt, the young man reflected a little, for he went towards his groom, saying: “this man is right; i did indeed charge him with a commission, the result of which he must tell me; walk to the barrier, there take a cab, that you may not be too late.” the surprised groom retired.
Perplexity: 188653360.0000

Sentence: “let me at least reach a shady spot,” said andrea.
Perplexity: 267862128.0000

Sentence: “oh, as for that, i’ll take you to a splendid place,” said the man with the handkerchief; and taking the horse’s bit he led the tilbury where it was certainly impossible for anyone to witness the honor that andrea conferred upon him.
Perplexity: 66117664.0000

Perplexity: 156465360.0000

Perplexity: 105166560.0000

Perplexity: 46310132.0000

Perplexity: 275886240.0000

Perplexity: 288896416.0000

Perplexity: 879821952.0000

Perplexity: 38192400.0000

Sentence: “excuse me,” said the banker, “but you will tire yourself, baroness, by such late hours, and m. debray lives some distance from here.” debray was petrified, not only to hear danglars speak so calmly and politely, but because it was apparent that beneath outward politeness there really lurked a determined spirit of opposition to anything his wife might wish to do.
Perplexity: 497588416.0000

Sentence: the baroness was also surprised, and showed her astonishment by a look which would doubtless have had some effect upon her husband if he had not been intently occupied with the paper, where he was looking to see the closing stock quotations.
Perplexity: 1198660352.0000

Sentence: the result was, that the proud look entirely failed of its purpose.

Sentence: “my dear m. debray,” said the banker, “do not kill yourself tonight listening to the follies of madame danglars, for you can hear them as well tomorrow; but i claim tonight and will devote it, if you will allow me, to talk over some serious matters with my wife.” this time the blow was so well aimed, and hit so directly, that lucien and the baroness were staggered, and they interrogated each other with their eyes, as if to seek help against this aggression, but the irresistible will of the master of the house prevailed, and the husband was victorious.
Perplexity: 291847840.0000

Perplexity: 87309288.0000

Perplexity: 99717376.0000

Sentence: “it is extraordinary,” he said, when the door was closed behind him, “how easily these husbands, whom we ridicule, gain an advantage over us.” 30241m lucien having left, danglars took his place on the sofa, closed the open book, and placing himself in a dreadfully dictatorial attitude, he began playing with the dog; but the animal, not liking him as well as debray, and attempting to bite him, danglars seized him by the skin of his neck and threw him upon a couch on the other side of the room.
Perplexity: 31426338.0000

Perplexity: 408307008.0000

Perplexity: 2656231680.0000

Sentence: my money boxes are my pactolus, as, i think, m. demoustier says, and i will not retard its course, or disturb its calm.
Perplexity: 3929116928.0000

Sentence: my clerks are honest men, who earn my fortune, whom i pay much below their deserts, if i may value them according to what they bring in; therefore i shall not get into a passion with them; those with whom i will be in a passion are those who eat my dinners, mount my horses, and exhaust my fortune.” “and pray who are the persons who exhaust your fortune?
Perplexity: 623305536.0000

Sentence: explain yourself more clearly, i beg, sir.” “oh, make yourself easy!—i am not speaking riddles, and you will soon know what i mean.
Perplexity: 174351744.0000

Sentence: the people who exhaust my fortune are those who draw out 700,000 francs in the course of an hour.” “i do not understand you, sir,” said the baroness, trying to disguise the agitation of her voice and the flush of her face.

Sentence: “you understand me perfectly, on the contrary,” said danglars: “but, if you will persist, i will tell you that i have just lost 700,000 francs upon the spanish loan.” “and pray,” asked the baroness, “am i responsible for this loss?” “why not?” “is it my fault you have lost 700,000 francs?” “certainly it is not mine.” “once for all, sir,” replied the baroness sharply, “i tell you i will not hear cash named; it is a style of language i never heard in the house of my parents or in that of my first husband.” “oh, i can well believe that, for neither of them was worth a penny.” “the better reason for my not being conversant with the slang of the bank, which is here dinning in my ears from morning to night; that noise of jingling crowns, which are constantly being counted and re-counted, is odious to me.
Perplexity: 148257152.0000

Sentence: i only know one thing i dislike more, which is the sound of your voice.” “really?” said danglars.

Perplexity: 502356448.0000

Perplexity: 167764576.0000

Sentence: he is a charming fellow, i allow, when his news is correct; but when it is not, there are fifty others in the world who would do better than he.” madame danglars was rooted to the spot; she made a violent effort to reply to this last attack, but she fell upon a chair thinking of villefort, of the dinner scene, of the strange series of misfortunes which had taken place in her house during the last few days, and changed the usual calm of her establishment to a scene of scandalous debate.

Perplexity: 1647820288.0000

Sentence: the papers said something about it, did they not?” “then you believe the papers?” “i?—not the least in the world; only i fancied that the honest _messager_ was an exception to the rule, and that it only announced telegraphic despatches.” “well, that’s what puzzles me,” replied danglars; “the news of the return of don carlos was brought by telegraph.” “so that,” said monte cristo, “you have lost nearly 1,700,000 francs this month.” “not nearly, indeed; that is exactly my loss.” “_diable!_” said monte cristo compassionately, “it is a hard blow for a third-rate fortune.” “third-rate,” said danglars, rather humble, “what do you mean by that?” “certainly,” continued monte cristo, “i make three assortments in fortune—first-rate, second-rate, and third-rate fortunes.
Perplexity: 201758400.0000

Sentence: i call those first-rate which are composed of treasures one possesses under one’s hand, such as mines, lands, and funded property, in such states as france, austria, and england, provided these treasures and property form a total of about a hundred millions; i call those second-rate fortunes, that are gained by manufacturing enterprises, joint-stock companies, viceroyalties, and principalities, not drawing more than 1,500,000 francs, the whole forming a capital of about fifty millions; finally, i call those third-rate fortunes, which are composed of a fluctuating capital, dependent upon the will of others, or upon chances which a bankruptcy involves or a false telegram shakes, such as banks, speculations of the day—in fact, all operations under the influence of greater or less mischances, the whole bringing in a real or fictitious capital of about fifteen millions.
Perplexity: 707709632.0000

Perplexity: 19092730.0000

Perplexity: 795092480.0000

Perplexity: 369149824.0000

Sentence: we have our clothes, some more splendid than others,—this is our credit; but when a man dies he has only his skin; in the same way, on retiring from business, you have nothing but your real principal of about five or six millions, at the most; for third-rate fortunes are never more than a fourth of what they appear to be, like the locomotive on a railway, the size of which is magnified by the smoke and steam surrounding it.
Perplexity: 258062768.0000

Sentence: well, out of the five or six millions which form your real capital, you have just lost nearly two millions, which must, of course, in the same degree diminish your credit and fictitious fortune; to follow out my simile, your skin has been opened by bleeding, and this if repeated three or four times will cause death—so pay attention to it, my dear monsieur danglars.
Perplexity: 999188544.0000

Sentence: do you want money?

Perplexity: 1003658176.0000

Perplexity: 804791616.0000

Sentence: but the wound remains and will reopen at the first loss.” “no, for i am only embarked in certainties,” replied danglars, with the air of a mountebank sounding his own praises; “to involve me, three governments must crumble to dust.” “well, such things have been.” “that there should be a famine!” “recollect the seven fat and the seven lean kine.” “or, that the sea should become dry, as in the days of pharaoh, and even then my vessels would become caravans.” “so much the better.
Perplexity: 634108544.0000

Sentence: i congratulate you, my dear m. danglars,” said monte cristo; “i see i was deceived, and that you belong to the class of second-rate fortunes.” “i think i may aspire to that honor,” said danglars with a smile, which reminded monte cristo of the sickly moons which bad artists are so fond of daubing into their pictures of ruins.
Perplexity: 247763152.0000

Sentence: “but, while we are speaking of business,” danglars added, pleased to find an opportunity of changing the subject, “tell me what i am to do for m. cavalcanti.” “give him money, if he is recommended to you, and the recommendation seems good.” “excellent; he presented himself this morning with a bond of 40,000 francs, payable at sight, on you, signed by busoni, and returned by you to me, with your endorsement—of course, i immediately counted him over the forty bank-notes.” monte cristo nodded his head in token of assent.
Perplexity: 303859456.0000

Sentence: “but that is not all,” continued danglars; “he has opened an account with my house for his son.” “may i ask how much he allows the young man?” “five thousand francs per month.” “sixty thousand francs per year.
Perplexity: 7632956928.0000

Sentence: i thought i was right in believing that cavalcanti to be a stingy fellow.
Perplexity: 404452416.0000

Sentence: how can a young man live upon 5,000 francs a month?” “but you understand that if the young man should want a few thousands more——” “do not advance it; the father will never repay it.
Perplexity: 233130928.0000

Sentence: you do not know these ultramontane millionaires; they are regular misers.
Perplexity: 417127200.0000

Perplexity: 180943744.0000

Sentence: i should never have taken him for anything more than a mere major.” “and you would have flattered him, for certainly, as you say, he has no manner.
Perplexity: 143662592.0000

Sentence: the first time i saw him he appeared to me like an old lieutenant who had grown mouldy under his epaulets.
Perplexity: 26266906.0000

Sentence: but all the italians are the same; they are like old jews when they are not glittering in oriental splendor.” “the young man is better,” said danglars.
Perplexity: 436865472.0000

Sentence: “yes; a little nervous, perhaps, but, upon the whole, he appeared tolerable.
Perplexity: 90157104.0000

Sentence: i was uneasy about him.” “why?” “because you met him at my house, just after his introduction into the world, as they told me.
Perplexity: 1459846144.0000

Sentence: he has been travelling with a very severe tutor, and had never been to paris before.” “ah, i believe noblemen marry amongst themselves, do they not?” asked danglars carelessly; “they like to unite their fortunes.” “it is usual, certainly; but cavalcanti is an original who does nothing like other people.
Perplexity: 231300816.0000

Sentence: i cannot help thinking that he has brought his son to france to choose a wife.” “do you think so?” “i am sure of it.” “and you have heard his fortune mentioned?” “nothing else was talked of; only some said he was worth millions, and others that he did not possess a farthing.” “and what is your opinion?” “i ought not to influence you, because it is only my own personal impression.” “well, and it is that——” “my opinion is, that all these old _podestàs_, these ancient _condottieri_,—for the cavalcanti have commanded armies and governed provinces,—my opinion, i say, is, that they have buried their millions in corners, the secret of which they have transmitted only to their eldest sons, who have done the same from generation to generation; and the proof of this is seen in their yellow and dry appearance, like the florins of the republic, which, from being constantly gazed upon, have become reflected in them.” “certainly,” said danglars, “and this is further supported by the fact of their not possessing an inch of land.” “very little, at least; i know of none which cavalcanti possesses, excepting his palace in lucca.” “ah, he has a palace?” said danglars, laughing; “come, that is something.” “yes; and more than that, he lets it to the minister of finance while he lives in a simple house.
Perplexity: 202790816.0000

Sentence: oh, as i told you before, i think the old fellow is very close.” “come, you do not flatter him.” “i scarcely know him; i think i have seen him three times in my life; all i know relating to him is through busoni and himself.
Perplexity: 546758784.0000

Sentence: he was telling me this morning that, tired of letting his property lie dormant in italy, which is a dead nation, he wished to find a method, either in france or england, of multiplying his millions, but remember, that though i place great confidence in busoni, i am not responsible for this.” “never mind; accept my thanks for the client you have sent me.
Perplexity: 1725304192.0000

Perplexity: 831579456.0000

Perplexity: 179203072.0000

Perplexity: 118699072.0000

Perplexity: 75510336.0000

Perplexity: 204177152.0000

Perplexity: 146546112.0000

Sentence: my sister is happily married; her husband is only my brother-in-law, that is, a man whom the ties of social life alone attach to me; no one then longer needs my useless life.
Perplexity: 126791712.0000

Sentence: this is what i shall do; i will wait until the very moment you are married, for i will not lose the shadow of one of those unexpected chances which are sometimes reserved for us, since m. franz may, after all, die before that time, a thunderbolt may fall even on the altar as you approach it,—nothing appears impossible to one condemned to die, and miracles appear quite reasonable when his escape from death is concerned.
Perplexity: 127953224.0000

Sentence: i will, then, wait until the last moment, and when my misery is certain, irremediable, hopeless, i will write a confidential letter to my brother-in-law, another to the prefect of police, to acquaint them with my intention, and at the corner of some wood, on the brink of some abyss, on the bank of some river, i will put an end to my existence, as certainly as i am the son of the most honest man who ever lived in france.” 30333m valentine trembled convulsively; she loosened her hold of the gate, her arms fell by her side, and two large tears rolled down her cheeks.

Perplexity: 436376640.0000

Sentence: “my god,” said valentine, raising both her hands to heaven with a sublime expression, “i have done my utmost to remain a submissive daughter; i have begged, entreated, implored; he has regarded neither my prayers, my entreaties, nor my tears.
Perplexity: 1338398976.0000

Perplexity: 429515360.0000

Sentence: now listen to me, maximilian; if by artifice, by entreaty, by accident—in short, if by any means i can delay this marriage, will you wait?” “yes, i promise you, as faithfully as you have promised me that this horrible marriage shall not take place, and that if you are dragged before a magistrate or a priest, you will refuse.” “i promise you by all that is most sacred to me in the world, namely, by my mother.” “we will wait, then,” said morrel.
Perplexity: 669778880.0000

Sentence: “yes, we will wait,” replied valentine, who revived at these words; “there are so many things which may save unhappy beings such as we are.” “i rely on you, valentine,” said morrel; “all you do will be well done; only if they disregard your prayers, if your father and madame de saint-méran insist that m. d’épinay should be called tomorrow to sign the contract——” “then you have my promise, maximilian.” “instead of signing——” “i will go to you, and we will fly; but from this moment until then, let us not tempt providence, let us not see each other.

Perplexity: 973140672.0000

Sentence: “my adored valentine, words cannot express one half of my satisfaction.” valentine had approached, or rather, had placed her lips so near the fence, that they nearly touched those of morrel, which were pressed against the other side of the cold and inexorable barrier.

Perplexity: 4359816704.0000

Perplexity: 29934078.0000

Perplexity: 284991488.0000

Perplexity: 637515072.0000

Sentence: “as a friend, and only as a friend, at this moment.
Perplexity: 735970304.0000

Sentence: the similarity in the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances is so great, that were i obliged to affirm by oath what i have now stated, i should hesitate; i therefore repeat to you, i speak not to a magistrate, but to a friend.
Perplexity: 907935808.0000

Sentence: and to that friend i say, ‘during the three-quarters of an hour that the struggle continued, i watched the convulsions and the death of madame de saint-méran, and am thoroughly convinced that not only did her death proceed from poison, but i could also specify the poison.’” “can it be possible?” “the symptoms are marked, do you see?—sleep broken by nervous spasms, excitation of the brain, torpor of the nerve centres.
Perplexity: 114103456.0000

Sentence: madame de saint-méran succumbed to a powerful dose of brucine or of strychnine, which by some mistake, perhaps, has been given to her.” villefort seized the doctor’s hand.

Perplexity: 1828851328.0000

Sentence: oh, if such a thought could present itself, i would stab myself to punish my heart for having for one instant harbored it.” “indeed, my dear friend,” said m. d’avrigny, “i would not accuse anyone; i speak only of an accident, you understand,—of a mistake,—but whether accident or mistake, the fact is there; it is on my conscience and compels me to speak aloud to you.
Perplexity: 88083400.0000

Sentence: make inquiry.” “of whom?—how?—of what?” “may not barrois, the old servant, have made a mistake, and have given madame de saint-méran a dose prepared for his master?” “for my father?” “yes.” “but how could a dose prepared for m. noirtier poison madame de saint-méran?” “nothing is more simple.

Perplexity: 420075712.0000

Sentence: this quantity, which is perfectly safe to administer to the paralyzed frame of m. noirtier, which has become gradually accustomed to it, would be sufficient to kill another person.” “my dear doctor, there is no communication between m. noirtier’s apartment and that of madame de saint-méran, and barrois never entered my mother-in-law’s room.
Perplexity: 299101216.0000

Sentence: in short, doctor although i know you to be the most conscientious man in the world, and although i place the utmost reliance in you, i want, notwithstanding my conviction, to believe this axiom, _errare humanum est_.” “is there one of my brethren in whom you have equal confidence with myself?” “why do you ask me that?—what do you wish?” “send for him; i will tell him what i have seen, and we will consult together, and examine the body.” “and you will find traces of poison?” “no, i did not say of poison, but we can prove what was the state of the body; we shall discover the cause of her sudden death, and we shall say, ‘dear villefort, if this thing has been caused by negligence, watch over your servants; if from hatred, watch your enemies.’” “what do you propose to me, d’avrigny?” said villefort in despair; “so soon as another is admitted into our secret, an inquest will become necessary; and an inquest in my house—impossible!
Perplexity: 117570216.0000

Sentence: still,” continued the procureur, looking at the doctor with uneasiness, “if you wish it—if you demand it, why then it shall be done.
Perplexity: 29535042.0000

Sentence: but, doctor, you see me already so grieved—how can i introduce into my house so much scandal, after so much sorrow?
Perplexity: 90945528.0000

Sentence: my wife and my daughter would die of it!
Perplexity: 764568832.0000

Sentence: and i, doctor—you know a man does not arrive at the post i occupy—one has not been king’s attorney twenty-five years without having amassed a tolerable number of enemies; mine are numerous.
Perplexity: 157144880.0000

Sentence: let this affair be talked of, it will be a triumph for them, which will make them rejoice, and cover me with shame.
Perplexity: 230434224.0000

Sentence: pardon me, doctor, these worldly ideas; were you a priest i should not dare tell you that, but you are a man, and you know mankind.
Perplexity: 85065016.0000

Sentence: doctor, pray recall your words; you have said nothing, have you?” “my dear m. de villefort,” replied the doctor, “my first duty is to humanity.
Perplexity: 259930064.0000

Sentence: i would have saved madame de saint-méran, if science could have done it; but she is dead and my duty regards the living.
Perplexity: 121419408.0000

Sentence: let us bury this terrible secret in the deepest recesses of our hearts; i am willing, if anyone should suspect this, that my silence on the subject should be imputed to my ignorance.
Perplexity: 66627464.0000

Sentence: meanwhile, sir, watch always—watch carefully, for perhaps the evil may not stop here.
Perplexity: 130089712.0000

Sentence: and when you have found the culprit, if you find him, i will say to you, ‘you are a magistrate, do as you will!’” “i thank you, doctor,” said villefort with indescribable joy; “i never had a better friend than you.” and, as if he feared doctor d’avrigny would recall his promise, he hurried him towards the house.
Perplexity: 66013960.0000

Perplexity: 114328496.0000

Sentence: “i am manifestly protected in a most wonderful, but most terrible manner,” said he; “but valentine, poor girl, how will she bear so much sorrow?” as he thought thus, he looked alternately at the window with red curtains and the three windows with white curtains.
Perplexity: 156300720.0000

Sentence: the light had almost disappeared from the former; doubtless madame de villefort had just put out her lamp, and the nightlamp alone reflected its dull light on the window.

Perplexity: 113307312.0000

Perplexity: 181022096.0000

Sentence: although it was impossible that valentine should see him, hidden as he was, he thought he heard the shadow at the window call him; his disturbed mind told him so.
Perplexity: 88789656.0000

Sentence: this double error became an irresistible reality, and by one of the incomprehensible transports of youth, he bounded from his hiding-place, and with two strides, at the risk of being seen, at the risk of alarming valentine, at the risk of being discovered by some exclamation which might escape the young girl, he crossed the flower-garden, which by the light of the moon resembled a large white lake, and having passed the rows of orange-trees which extended in front of the house, he reached the step, ran quickly up and pushed the door, which opened without offering any resistance.

Sentence: happily he did not meet anyone.
Perplexity: 148566832.0000

Perplexity: 98225912.0000

Sentence: he turned back, a door partly open enabled him to see his road, and to hear the voice of one in sorrow.

Sentence: the moon shining through the open blinds made the lamp appear to burn paler, and cast a sepulchral hue over the whole scene.
Perplexity: 434543584.0000

Perplexity: 565278016.0000

Perplexity: 1692272512.0000

Sentence: morrel shuddered as he thought of the conversation of the doctor and m. de villefort, and he thought he could see through the sheet the extended hands, the stiff neck, and the purple lips.

Sentence: “your servants,” said he, “who were repeating the whole of the sorrowful story; from them i learned it all.” “but it was risking the failure of our plan to come up here, love.” “forgive me,” replied morrel; “i will go away.” “no,” said valentine, “you might meet someone; stay.” “but if anyone should come here——” the young girl shook her head.

Perplexity: 1467277184.0000

Sentence: i will tell him the ties which bind me to mademoiselle valentine; if he be a sensible man, he will prove it by renouncing of his own accord the hand of his betrothed, and will secure my friendship, and love until death; if he refuse, either through interest or ridiculous pride, after i have proved to him that he would be forcing my wife from me, that valentine loves me, and will have no other, i will fight with him, give him every advantage, and i shall kill him, or he will kill me; if i am victorious, he will not marry valentine, and if i die, i am very sure valentine will not marry him.” noirtier watched, with indescribable pleasure, this noble and sincere countenance, on which every sentiment his tongue uttered was depicted, adding by the expression of his fine features all that coloring adds to a sound and faithful drawing.
Perplexity: 250531232.0000

Perplexity: 279375872.0000

Sentence: “what do you wish, sir?” asked morrel; “that i should renew my promise of remaining tranquil?” noirtier’s eye remained fixed and firm, as if to imply that a promise did not suffice; then it passed from his face to his hands.

Perplexity: 434298304.0000

Sentence: it appeared impossible to the baroness that a man of such delightfully pleasing manners should entertain evil designs against her; besides, the most corrupt minds only suspect evil when it would answer some interested end—useless injury is repugnant to every mind.

Perplexity: 525777664.0000

Sentence: “well,” said the banker to his daughter, “are we then all to be excluded?” he then led the young man into the study, and either by chance or manœuvre the door was partially closed after andrea, so that from the place where they sat neither the count nor the baroness could see anything; but as the banker had accompanied andrea, madame danglars appeared to take no notice of it.
Perplexity: 930740672.0000

Sentence: the count soon heard andrea’s voice, singing a corsican song, accompanied by the piano.
Perplexity: 204369632.0000

Perplexity: 157108912.0000

Sentence: the praise was well deserved, for had not the count heard it from the baroness, or by one of those means by which he knew everything, the baron’s countenance would not have led him to suspect it.

Perplexity: 245107472.0000

Sentence: fortune is precarious; and if i were a woman and fate had made me a banker’s wife, whatever might be my confidence in my husband’s good fortune, still in speculation you know there is great risk.
Perplexity: 231077696.0000

Sentence: well, i would secure for myself a fortune independent of him, even if i acquired it by placing my interests in hands unknown to him.” madame danglars blushed, in spite of all her efforts.
Perplexity: 148610480.0000

Sentence: “stay,” said monte cristo, as though he had not observed her confusion, “i have heard of a lucky hit that was made yesterday on the neapolitan bonds.” “i have none—nor have i ever possessed any; but really we have talked long enough of money, count, we are like two stockbrokers; have you heard how fate is persecuting the poor villeforts?” “what has happened?” said the count, simulating total ignorance.

Perplexity: 127713784.0000

Sentence: “well,” said the baroness, “do you leave m. cavalcanti with your daughter?” “and mademoiselle d’armilly,” said the banker; “do you consider her no one?” then, turning to monte cristo, he said, “prince cavalcanti is a charming young man, is he not?

Perplexity: 413560704.0000

Sentence: “i, too,” said the young man, “am a musician—at least, my masters used to tell me so; but it is strange that my voice never would suit any other, and a soprano less than any.” danglars smiled, and seemed to say, “it is of no consequence.” then, hoping doubtless to effect his purpose, he said,—“the prince and my daughter were universally admired yesterday.
Perplexity: 1943273984.0000

Perplexity: 502420672.0000

Perplexity: 110682128.0000

Sentence: it’s a month now that you have been thinking of this marriage, and you must see that it throws some responsibility on me, for it was at my house you met this young cavalcanti, whom i do not really know at all.” “but i do.” “have you made inquiry?” “is there any need of that!

Perplexity: 462570944.0000

Sentence: “he is a musician.” “so are all italians.” “come, count, you do not do that young man justice.” “well, i acknowledge it annoys me, knowing your connection with the morcerf family, to see him throw himself in the way.” danglars burst out laughing.

Sentence: “really, my dear count,” said morcerf, “what i admire in you is, not so much your riches, for perhaps there are people even wealthier than yourself, nor is it only your wit, for beaumarchais might have possessed as much,—but it is your manner of being served, without any questions, in a moment, in a second; it is as if they guessed what you wanted by your manner of ringing, and made a point of keeping everything you can possibly desire in constant readiness.” “what you say is perhaps true; they know my habits.

Perplexity: 23926692.0000

Sentence: only think, then, if mademoiselle danglars, instead of being called claire-marie-eugénie, had been named mademoiselle chastity-modesty-innocence danglars; what a fine effect that would have produced on the announcement of her marriage!” “hush,” said the count, “do not joke in so loud a tone; haydée may hear you, perhaps.” “and you think she would be angry?” “no, certainly not,” said the count with a haughty expression.

Perplexity: 2362546432.0000

Perplexity: 176080880.0000

Sentence: then, turning towards albert,—“it is a pity you do not understand either ancient or modern greek, both of which haydée speaks so fluently; the poor child will be obliged to talk to you in italian, which will give you but a very false idea of her powers of conversation.” the count made a sign to haydée to address his visitor.
Perplexity: 3970324736.0000

Sentence: “sir,” she said to morcerf, “you are most welcome as the friend of my lord and master.” this was said in excellent tuscan, and with that soft roman accent which makes the language of dante as sonorous as that of homer.

Perplexity: 94970400.0000

Sentence: oh, signora, if i could but speak greek, your conversation, added to the fairy-scene which surrounds me, would furnish an evening of such delight as it would be impossible for me ever to forget.” “i speak sufficient italian to enable me to converse with you, sir,” said haydée quietly; “and if you like what is eastern, i will do my best to secure the gratification of your tastes while you are here.” “on what subject shall i converse with her?” said albert, in a low tone to monte cristo.
Perplexity: 100080168.0000

Sentence: “just what you please; you may speak of her country and of her youthful reminiscences, or if you like it better you can talk of rome, naples, or florence.” “oh,” said albert, “it is of no use to be in the company of a greek if one converses just in the same style as with a parisian; let me speak to her of the east.” “do so then, for of all themes which you could choose that will be the most agreeable to her taste.” albert turned towards haydée.

Perplexity: 5747093504.0000

Sentence: you prohibited my mentioning my father’s name to her, but perhaps she will allude to him of her own accord in the course of the recital, and you have no idea how delighted i should be to hear our name pronounced by such beautiful lips.” monte cristo turned to haydée, and with an expression of countenance which commanded her to pay the most implicit attention to his words, he said in greek, “πατρὸς μὲν ἄτην μήζε τὸ ὄνομα προδότου καὶ προδοσίαν εἰπὲ ἡμῖν,”—that is, “tell us the fate of your father; but neither the name of the traitor nor the treason.” haydée sighed deeply, and a shade of sadness clouded her beautiful brow.

Perplexity: 301557504.0000

Sentence: under the oldest and thickest of these trees, reclining on cushions, sat my father; my mother was at his feet, and i, childlike, amused myself by playing with his long white beard which descended to his girdle, or with the diamond-hilt of the scimitar attached to his girdle.
Perplexity: 263813936.0000

Sentence: then from time to time there came to him an albanian who said something to which i paid no attention, but which he always answered in the same tone of voice, either ‘kill,’ or ‘pardon.’” “it is very strange,” said albert, “to hear such words proceed from the mouth of anyone but an actress on the stage, and one needs constantly to be saying to one’s self, ‘this is no fiction, it is all reality,’ in order to believe it.
Perplexity: 1671708544.0000

Sentence: and how does france appear in your eyes, accustomed as they have been to gaze on such enchanted scenes?” “i think it is a fine country,” said haydée, “but i see france as it really is, because i look on it with the eyes of a woman; whereas my own country, which i can only judge of from the impression produced on my childish mind, always seems enveloped in a vague atmosphere, which is luminous or otherwise, according as my remembrances of it are sad or joyous.” “so young,” said albert, forgetting at the moment the count’s command that he should ask no questions of the slave herself, “is it possible that you can have known what suffering is except by name?” haydée turned her eyes towards monte cristo, who, making at the same time some imperceptible sign, murmured: “εἰπέ—speak.” “nothing is ever so firmly impressed on the mind as the memory of our early childhood, and with the exception of the two scenes i have just described to you, all my earliest reminiscences are fraught with deepest sadness.” 40068m “speak, speak, signora,” said albert, “i am listening with the most intense delight and interest to all you say.” haydée answered his remark with a melancholy smile.

Sentence: my father,” said haydée, raising her head, “was that illustrious man known in europe under the name of ali tepelini, pasha of yanina, and before whom turkey trembled.” albert, without knowing why, started on hearing these words pronounced with such a haughty and dignified accent; it appeared to him as if there was something supernaturally gloomy and terrible in the expression which gleamed from the brilliant eyes of haydée at this moment; she appeared like a pythoness evoking a spectre, as she recalled to his mind the remembrance of the fearful death of this man, to the news of which all europe had listened with horror.
Perplexity: 2157471488.0000

Sentence: as to haydée, these terrible reminiscences seemed to have overpowered her for a moment, for she ceased speaking, her head leaning on her hand like a beautiful flower bowing beneath the violence of the storm; and her eyes gazing on vacancy indicated that she was mentally contemplating the green summit of the pindus and the blue waters of the lake of yanina, which, like a magic mirror, seemed to reflect the sombre picture which she sketched.

Sentence: m. d’épinay must say that he is shocked and astonished that m. de villefort, who appeared to be aware of all the circumstances detailed this morning, should not have anticipated him in this announcement.” no one who had seen the magistrate at this moment, so thoroughly unnerved by the recent inauspicious combination of circumstances, would have supposed for an instant that he had anticipated the annoyance; although it certainly never had occurred to him that his father would carry candor, or rather rudeness, so far as to relate such a history.
Perplexity: 59816136.0000

Sentence: and in justice to villefort, it must be understood that m. noirtier, who never cared for the opinion of his son on any subject, had always omitted to explain the affair to villefort, so that he had all his life entertained the belief that general de quesnel, or the baron d’épinay, as he was alternately styled, according as the speaker wished to identify him by his own family name, or by the title which had been conferred on him, fell the victim of assassination, and not that he was killed fairly in a duel.

Sentence: determined to bear it no longer, she arose and left the room; saying she would go and make some inquiries into the cause of his sudden disappearance.
Perplexity: 210042960.0000

Perplexity: 221564592.0000

Sentence: during this time valentine, at once terrified and happy, after having embraced and thanked the feeble old man for thus breaking with a single blow the chain which she had been accustomed to consider as irrefragable, asked leave to retire to her own room, in order to recover her composure.
Perplexity: 117858040.0000

Perplexity: 38329668.0000

Sentence: in the midst of all the strange events which had crowded one on the other, an indefinable sentiment of dread had taken possession of valentine’s mind.
Perplexity: 235473552.0000

Perplexity: 166173840.0000

Sentence: the first glance which maximilian directed towards her entirely reassured him, and the first words she spoke made his heart bound with delight.
Perplexity: 618839616.0000

Perplexity: 107234040.0000

Sentence: “saved?” repeated morrel, not being able to conceive such intense happiness; “by whom?” “by my grandfather.
Perplexity: 97180464.0000

Sentence: oh, morrel, pray love him for all his goodness to us!” morrel swore to love him with all his soul; and at that moment he could safely promise to do so, for he felt as though it were not enough to love him merely as a friend or even as a father, he worshiped him as a god.
Perplexity: 1350652032.0000

Sentence: “but tell me, valentine, how has it all been effected?
Perplexity: 376717280.0000

Sentence: what strange means has he used to compass this blessed end?” valentine was on the point of relating all that had passed, but she suddenly remembered that in doing so she must reveal a terrible secret which concerned others as well as her grandfather, and she said: “at some future time i will tell you all about it.” “but when will that be?” “when i am your wife.” the conversation had now turned upon a topic so pleasing to morrel, that he was ready to accede to anything that valentine thought fit to propose, and he likewise felt that a piece of intelligence such as he just heard ought to be more than sufficient to content him for one day.
Perplexity: 29626104.0000

Sentence: however, he would not leave without the promise of seeing valentine again the next night.
Perplexity: 12638500864.0000

Sentence: valentine promised all that morrel required of her, and certainly it was less difficult now for her to believe that she should marry maximilian than it was an hour ago to assure herself that she should not marry franz.

Sentence: during the time occupied by the interview we have just detailed, madame de villefort had gone to visit m. noirtier.
Perplexity: 1272341504.0000

Sentence: the old man looked at her with that stern and forbidding expression with which he was accustomed to receive her.
Perplexity: 326462176.0000

Sentence: “sir,” said she, “it is superfluous for me to tell you that valentine’s marriage is broken off, since it was here that the affair was concluded.” noirtier’s countenance remained immovable.
Perplexity: 104209928.0000

Sentence: “but one thing i can tell you, of which i do not think you are aware; that is, that i have always been opposed to this marriage, and that the contract was entered into entirely without my consent or approbation.” noirtier regarded his daughter-in-law with the look of a man desiring an explanation.
Perplexity: 135351648.0000

Sentence: “now that this marriage, which i know you so much disliked, is done away with, i come to you on an errand which neither m. de villefort nor valentine could consistently undertake.” noirtier’s eyes demanded the nature of her mission.
Perplexity: 145595504.0000

Sentence: “i come to entreat you, sir,” continued madame de villefort, “as the only one who has the right of doing so, inasmuch as i am the only one who will receive no personal benefit from the transaction,—i come to entreat you to restore, not your love, for that she has always possessed, but to restore your fortune to your granddaughter.” there was a doubtful expression in noirtier’s eyes; he was evidently trying to discover the motive of this proceeding, and he could not succeed in doing so.
Perplexity: 80358408.0000

Sentence: the next day m. noirtier sent for the notary; the first will was torn up and a second made, in which he left the whole of his fortune to valentine, on condition that she should never be separated from him.

Sentence: while all the proceedings relative to the dissolution of the marriage-contract were being carried on at the house of m. de villefort, monte cristo had paid his visit to the count of morcerf, who, in order to lose no time in responding to m. danglars’ wishes, and at the same time to pay all due deference to his position in society, donned his uniform of lieutenant-general, which he ornamented with all his crosses, and thus attired, ordered his finest horses and drove to the rue de la chaussée d’antin.

Perplexity: 251546320.0000

Sentence: morcerf, usually so stiff and formal, accosted the banker in an affable and smiling manner, and, feeling sure that the overture he was about to make would be well received, he did not consider it necessary to adopt any manœuvres in order to gain his end, but went at once straight to the point.
Perplexity: 425646464.0000

Sentence: 40086m “well, baron,” said he, “here i am at last; some time has elapsed since our plans were formed, and they are not yet executed.” morcerf paused at these words, quietly waiting till the cloud should have dispersed which had gathered on the brow of danglars, and which he attributed to his silence; but, on the contrary, to his great surprise, it grew darker and darker.
Perplexity: 893678848.0000

Sentence: “to what do you allude, monsieur?” said danglars; as if he were trying in vain to guess at the possible meaning of the general’s words.
Perplexity: 37194844.0000

Sentence: “ah,” said morcerf, “i see you are a stickler for forms, my dear sir, and you would remind me that the ceremonial rites should not be omitted.
Perplexity: 361484096.0000

Sentence: _ma foi_, i beg your pardon, but as i have but one son, and it is the first time i have ever thought of marrying him, i am still serving my apprenticeship, you know; come, i will reform.” and morcerf with a forced smile arose, and, making a low bow to m. danglars, said: “baron, i have the honor of asking of you the hand of mademoiselle eugénie danglars for my son, the vicomte albert de morcerf.” but danglars, instead of receiving this address in the favorable manner which morcerf had expected, knit his brow, and without inviting the count, who was still standing, to take a seat, he said: “monsieur, it will be necessary to reflect before i give you an answer.” “to reflect?” said morcerf, more and more astonished; “have you not had enough time for reflection during the eight years which have elapsed since this marriage was first discussed between us?” “count,” said the banker, “things are constantly occurring in the world to induce us to lay aside our most established opinions, or at all events to cause us to remodel them according to the change of circumstances, which may have placed affairs in a totally different light to that in which we at first viewed them.” “i do not understand you, baron,” said morcerf.
Perplexity: 279641920.0000

Sentence: “what i mean to say is this, sir,—that during the last fortnight unforeseen circumstances have occurred——” “excuse me,” said morcerf, “but is it a play we are acting?” “a play?” “yes, for it is like one; pray let us come more to the point, and endeavor thoroughly to understand each other.” “that is quite my desire.” “you have seen m. de monte cristo have you not?” “i see him very often,” said danglars, drawing himself up; “he is a particular friend of mine.” “well, in one of your late conversations with him, you said that i appeared to be forgetful and irresolute concerning this marriage, did you not?” “i did say so.” “well, here i am, proving at once that i am really neither the one nor the other, by entreating you to keep your promise on that score.” danglars did not answer.
Perplexity: 1187127168.0000

Sentence: “have you so soon changed your mind,” added morcerf, “or have you only provoked my request that you may have the pleasure of seeing me humbled?” danglars, seeing that if he continued the conversation in the same tone in which he had begun it, the whole thing might turn out to his own disadvantage, turned to morcerf, and said: “count, you must doubtless be surprised at my reserve, and i assure you it costs me much to act in such a manner towards you; but, believe me when i say that imperative necessity has imposed the painful task upon me.” “these are all so many empty words, my dear sir,” said morcerf: “they might satisfy a new acquaintance, but the comte de morcerf does not rank in that list; and when a man like him comes to another, recalls to him his plighted word, and this man fails to redeem the pledge, he has at least a right to exact from him a good reason for so doing.” danglars was a coward, but did not wish to appear so; he was piqued at the tone which morcerf had just assumed.

Perplexity: 81783912.0000

Sentence: “what do you mean to say?” “i mean to say that i have a good reason, but that it is difficult to explain.” “you must be aware, at all events, that it is impossible for me to understand motives before they are explained to me; but one thing at least is clear, which is, that you decline allying yourself with my family.” “no, sir,” said danglars; “i merely suspend my decision, that is all.” “and do you really flatter yourself that i shall yield to all your caprices, and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received into your good graces?” “then, count, if you will not wait, we must look upon these projects as if they had never been entertained.” the count bit his lips till the blood almost started, to prevent the ebullition of anger which his proud and irritable temper scarcely allowed him to restrain; understanding, however, that in the present state of things the laugh would decidedly be against him, he turned from the door, towards which he had been directing his steps, and again confronted the banker.

Perplexity: 353172928.0000

Sentence: no, do not seek any longer to discover the reason.
Perplexity: 1035855488.0000

Perplexity: 84502736.0000

Sentence: while we wait, time will be progressing, events will succeed each other; things which in the evening look dark and obscure, appear but too clearly in the light of morning, and sometimes the utterance of one word, or the lapse of a single day, will reveal the most cruel calumnies.” “calumnies, did you say, sir?” cried morcerf, turning livid with rage.
Perplexity: 22856716.0000

Sentence: “does anyone dare to slander me?” “monsieur, i told you that i considered it best to avoid all explanation.” “then, sir, i am patiently to submit to your refusal?” “yes, sir, although i assure you the refusal is as painful for me to give as it is for you to receive, for i had reckoned on the honor of your alliance, and the breaking off of a marriage contract always injures the lady more than the gentleman.” “enough, sir,” said morcerf, “we will speak no more on the subject.” and clutching his gloves in anger, he left the apartment.

Sentence: he hastily tore off the cover, opened the journal with nervous precipitation, passed contemptuously over the paris jottings, and arriving at the miscellaneous intelligence, stopped with a malicious smile, at a paragraph headed _we hear from yanina._ “very good,” observed danglars, after having read the paragraph; “here is a little article on colonel fernand, which, if i am not mistaken, would render the explanation which the comte de morcerf required of me perfectly unnecessary.” at the same moment, that is, at nine o’clock in the morning, albert de morcerf, dressed in a black coat buttoned up to his chin, might have been seen walking with a quick and agitated step in the direction of monte cristo’s house in the champs-élysées.

Perplexity: 59312504.0000

Sentence: do you think it will be long before he comes in?” “no, i think not, for he ordered his breakfast at ten o’clock.” “well, i will go and take a turn in the champs-élysées, and at ten o’clock i will return here; meanwhile, if the count should come in, will you beg him not to go out again without seeing me?” “you may depend on my doing so, sir,” said baptistin.

Sentence: the castle which formed the protection of the town was given up to the turks by a french officer named fernand, in whom the grand vizier, ali tepelini, had reposed the greatest confidence.” “well,” said monte cristo, “what do you see in that to annoy you?” “what do i see in it?” “yes; what does it signify to you if the castle of yanina was given up by a french officer?” “it signifies to my father, the count of morcerf, whose christian name is fernand!” “did your father serve under ali pasha?” “yes; that is to say, he fought for the independence of the greeks, and hence arises the calumny.” “oh, my dear viscount, do talk reason!” “i do not desire to do otherwise.” “now, just tell me who the devil should know in france that the officer fernand and the count of morcerf are one and the same person?

Perplexity: 111979336.0000

Perplexity: 30527794.0000

Sentence: well, if so, why do you object to my doing so?” “i do not say that you ought not to fight, i only say that a duel is a serious thing, and ought not to be undertaken without due reflection.” “did he reflect before he insulted my father?” “if he spoke hastily, and owns that he did so, you ought to be satisfied.” “ah, my dear count, you are far too indulgent.” “and you are far too exacting.
Perplexity: 35099428.0000

Sentence: supposing, for instance, and do not be angry at what i am going to say——” “well.” “supposing the assertion to be really true?” “a son ought not to submit to such a stain on his father’s honor.” “_ma foi!_ we live in times when there is much to which we must submit.” “that is precisely the fault of the age.” “and do you undertake to reform it?” “yes, as far as i am personally concerned.” “well, you are indeed exacting, my dear fellow!” “yes, i own it.” “are you quite impervious to good advice?” “not when it comes from a friend.” “and do you account me that title?” “certainly i do.” “well, then, before going to beauchamp with your witnesses, seek further information on the subject.” “from whom?” “from haydée.” “why, what can be the use of mixing a woman up in the affair?—what can she do in it?” “she can declare to you, for example, that your father had no hand whatever in the defeat and death of the vizier; or if by chance he had, indeed, the misfortune to——” “i have told you, my dear count, that i would not for one moment admit of such a proposition.” “you reject this means of information, then?” “i do—most decidedly.” “then let me offer one more word of advice.” “do so, then, but let it be the last.” “you do not wish to hear it, perhaps?” “on the contrary, i request it.” “do not take any witnesses with you when you go to beauchamp—visit him alone.” “that would be contrary to all custom.” “your case is not an ordinary one.” “and what is your reason for advising me to go alone?” “because then the affair will rest between you and beauchamp.” “explain yourself.” “i will do so.
Perplexity: 49990072.0000

Perplexity: 102353896.0000

Sentence: see, i have thought about you—look at the good breakfast we are going to have; nothing but what you are fond of.” andrea, indeed, inhaled the scent of something cooking which was not unwelcome to him, hungry as he was; it was that mixture of fat and garlic peculiar to provençal kitchens of an inferior order, added to that of dried fish, and above all, the pungent smell of musk and cloves.

Perplexity: 63734332.0000

Sentence: perhaps i may one day put on my best coat, and presenting myself at the great gate, introduce myself.
Perplexity: 402897856.0000

Perplexity: 139442704.0000

Perplexity: 132490888.0000

Sentence: no, fifteen thousand are not enough,—i cannot again become an honest man with less than thirty thousand francs.” “no,” replied andrea, dryly, “no, i cannot.” “i do not think you understand me,” replied caderousse, calmly; “i said without your laying out a sou.” “do you want me to commit a robbery, to spoil all my good fortune—and yours with mine—and both of us to be dragged down there again?” “it would make very little difference to me,” said caderousse, “if i were retaken, i am a poor creature to live alone, and sometimes pine for my old comrades; not like you, heartless creature, who would be glad never to see them again.” andrea did more than tremble this time, he turned pale.

Perplexity: 249534512.0000

Sentence: “true,” he replied, “and my protector is very kind.” “that dear protector,” said caderousse; “and how much does he give you monthly?” “five thousand francs.” “as many thousands as you give me hundreds!

Perplexity: 77064880.0000

Perplexity: 49563596.0000

Sentence: and you say that by his will——” “he leaves me five hundred thousand livres.” “are you sure of it?” “he showed it me; but that is not all—there is a codicil, as i said just now.” “probably.” “and in that codicil he acknowledges me.” “oh, the good father, the brave father, the very honest father!” said caderousse, twirling a plate in the air between his two hands.
Perplexity: 580961408.0000

Sentence: “now, say if i conceal anything from you?” “no, and your confidence makes you honorable in my opinion; and your princely father, is he rich, very rich?” “yes, he is that; he does not himself know the amount of his fortune.” “is it possible?” “it is evident enough to me, who am always at his house.
Perplexity: 256168816.0000

Sentence: the other day a banker’s clerk brought him fifty thousand francs in a portfolio about the size of your plate; yesterday his banker brought him a hundred thousand francs in gold.” caderousse was filled with wonder; the young man’s words sounded to him like metal, and he thought he could hear the rushing of cascades of louis.

Perplexity: 842557440.0000

Sentence: the famous secretaire is in the dressing-room.” “is there a window in the dressing-room?” “two,—one here and one there.” andrea sketched two windows in the room, which formed an angle on the plan, and appeared as a small square added to the rectangle of the bedroom.

Perplexity: 195691600.0000

Sentence: “yellow boys?” said caderousse; “no, i thank you.” “oh, you despise them.” “on the contrary, i esteem them, but will not have them.” “you can change them, idiot; gold is worth five sous.” “exactly; and he who changes them will follow friend caderousse, lay hands on him, and demand what farmers pay him their rent in gold.
Perplexity: 88122720.0000

Sentence: eh?
Perplexity: 58840156.0000

Perplexity: 303726208.0000

Perplexity: 125162144.0000

Sentence: you put on a livery, you disguise yourself as a servant, and yet keep a diamond on your finger worth four or five thousand francs.” “you guess well.” “i know something of diamonds; i have had some.” “you do well to boast of it,” said andrea, who, without becoming angry, as caderousse feared, at this new extortion, quietly resigned the ring.

Perplexity: 74684720.0000

Sentence: “_confiteor!_” said caderousse, putting the diamond on his little finger; “i was mistaken; but those thieves of jewellers imitate so well that it is no longer worthwhile to rob a jeweller’s shop—it is another branch of industry paralyzed.” “have you finished?” said andrea,—“do you want anything more?—will you have my waistcoat or my hat?
Perplexity: 2966515200.0000

Sentence: make free, now you have begun.” “no; you are, after all, a good companion; i will not detain you, and will try to cure myself of my ambition.” “but take care the same thing does not happen to you in selling the diamond you feared with the gold.” “i shall not sell it—do not fear.” “not at least till the day after tomorrow,” thought the young man.
Perplexity: 45017352.0000

Sentence: “happy rogue,” said caderousse; “you are going to find your servants, your horses, your carriage, and your betrothed!” “yes,” said andrea.
Perplexity: 841950144.0000

Sentence: “well, i hope you will make a handsome wedding-present the day you marry mademoiselle danglars.” “i have already told you it is a fancy you have taken in your head.” “what fortune has she?” “but i tell you——” “a million?” andrea shrugged his shoulders.
Perplexity: 196405824.0000

Sentence: “let it be a million,” said caderousse; “you can never have so much as i wish you.” “thank you,” said the young man.
Perplexity: 575921600.0000

Sentence: “oh, i wish it you with all my heart!” added caderousse with his hoarse laugh.
Perplexity: 32575602.0000

Sentence: “stop, let me show you the way.” “it is not worthwhile.” “yes, it is.” “why?” “because there is a little secret, a precaution i thought it desirable to take, one of huret & fichet’s locks, revised and improved by gaspard caderousse; i will manufacture you a similar one when you are a capitalist.” “thank you,” said andrea; “i will let you know a week beforehand.” they parted.
Perplexity: 200929264.0000

Sentence: caderousse remained on the landing until he had not only seen andrea go down the three stories, but also cross the court.
Perplexity: 83001344.0000

Perplexity: 71579480.0000

Sentence: he was induced to undertake this journey, of which the day before he had not even thought and which had not occurred to andrea either, by the arrival of bertuccio from normandy with intelligence respecting the house and sloop.
Perplexity: 69039544.0000

Sentence: the house was ready, and the sloop which had arrived a week before lay at anchor in a small creek with her crew of six men, who had observed all the requisite formalities and were ready again to put to sea.
Perplexity: 62957692.0000

Sentence: the count praised bertuccio’s zeal, and ordered him to prepare for a speedy departure, as his stay in france would not be prolonged more than a month.
Perplexity: 191316368.0000

Sentence: “now,” said he, “i may require to go in one night from paris to tréport; let eight fresh horses be in readiness on the road, which will enable me to go fifty leagues in ten hours.” “your highness had already expressed that wish,” said bertuccio, “and the horses are ready.
Perplexity: 78326560.0000

Sentence: i have bought them, and stationed them myself at the most desirable posts, that is, in villages, where no one generally stops.” “that’s well,” said monte cristo; “i remain here a day or two—arrange accordingly.” as bertuccio was leaving the room to give the requisite orders, baptistin opened the door: he held a letter on a silver waiter.
Perplexity: 174558384.0000

Sentence: “what are you doing here?” asked the count, seeing him covered with dust; “i did not send for you, i think?” baptistin, without answering, approached the count, and presented the letter.

Sentence: “important and urgent,” said he.
Perplexity: 48927800.0000

Perplexity: 46871120.0000

Sentence: de monte cristo is apprised that this night a man will enter his house in the champs-élysées with the intention of carrying off some papers supposed to be in the secretaire in the dressing-room.
Perplexity: 138820928.0000

Sentence: the count’s well-known courage will render unnecessary the aid of the police, whose interference might seriously affect him who sends this advice.
Perplexity: 133482920.0000

Sentence: the count, by any opening from the bedroom, or by concealing himself in the dressing-room, would be able to defend his property himself.
Perplexity: 62683780.0000

Sentence: many attendants or apparent precautions would prevent the villain from the attempt, and m. de monte cristo would lose the opportunity of discovering an enemy whom chance has revealed to him who now sends this warning to the count,—a warning he might not be able to send another time, if this first attempt should fail and another be made.’” the count’s first idea was that this was an artifice—a gross deception, to draw his attention from a minor danger in order to expose him to a greater.
Perplexity: 142277872.0000

Sentence: he was on the point of sending the letter to the commissary of police, notwithstanding the advice of his anonymous friend, or perhaps because of that advice, when suddenly the idea occurred to him that it might be some personal enemy, whom he alone should recognize and over whom, if such were the case, he alone would gain any advantage, as fiesco17 had done over the moor who would have killed him.
Perplexity: 161383472.0000

Sentence: we know the count’s vigorous and daring mind, denying anything to be impossible, with that energy which marks the great man.
Perplexity: 1085575424.0000

Sentence: from his past life, from his resolution to shrink from nothing, the count had acquired an inconceivable relish for the contests in which he had engaged, sometimes against nature, that is to say, against god, and sometimes against the world, that is, against the devil.
Perplexity: 4137376512.0000

Sentence: “they do not want my papers,” said monte cristo, “they want to kill me; they are no robbers, but assassins.
Perplexity: 1231282432.0000

Sentence: i will not allow the prefect of police to interfere with my private affairs.
Perplexity: 459981696.0000

Sentence: “return to paris,” said he; “assemble the servants who remain there.
Perplexity: 633031808.0000

Sentence: i want all my household at auteuil.” “but will no one remain in the house, my lord?” asked baptistin.
Perplexity: 145717472.0000

Sentence: “yes, the porter.” “my lord will remember that the lodge is at a distance from the house.” “well?” “the house might be stripped without his hearing the least noise.” “by whom?” “by thieves.” “you are a fool, m. baptistin.
Perplexity: 250962624.0000

Sentence: thieves might strip the house—it would annoy me less than to be disobeyed.” baptistin bowed.

Perplexity: 480566720.0000

Perplexity: 1672308224.0000

Sentence: having dined with his usual tranquillity and moderation, the count, making a signal to ali to follow him, went out by the side-gate and on reaching the bois de boulogne turned, apparently without design towards paris and at twilight; found himself opposite his house in the champs-élysées.
Perplexity: 725021888.0000

Sentence: all was dark; one solitary, feeble light was burning in the porter’s lodge, about forty paces distant from the house, as baptistin had said.
Perplexity: 3203318528.0000

Sentence: monte cristo leaned against a tree, and with that scrutinizing glance which was so rarely deceived, looked up and down the avenue, examined the passers-by, and carefully looked down the neighboring streets, to see that no one was concealed.

Sentence: ten minutes passed thus, and he was convinced that no one was watching him.
Perplexity: 101366744.0000

Sentence: he hastened to the side-door with ali, entered hurriedly, and by the servants’ staircase, of which he had the key, gained his bedroom without opening or disarranging a single curtain, without even the porter having the slightest suspicion that the house, which he supposed empty, contained its chief occupant.
Perplexity: 2142180864.0000

Perplexity: 100848752.0000

Sentence: he double locked it, took the key, returned to the bedroom door, removed the double staple of the bolt, and went in.
Perplexity: 449731776.0000

Sentence: meanwhile ali had procured the arms the count required—namely, a short carbine and a pair of double-barrelled pistols, with which as sure an aim might be taken as with a single-barrelled one.
Perplexity: 6659945472.0000

Sentence: thus armed, the count held the lives of five men in his hands.
Perplexity: 780867392.0000

Sentence: it was about half-past nine.
Perplexity: 476798720.0000

Perplexity: 93002320.0000

Perplexity: 362064416.0000

Perplexity: 238904960.0000

Sentence: the little light in the lodge had long been extinct.
Perplexity: 859458944.0000

Sentence: it might be expected that the attack, if indeed an attack was projected, would be made from the staircase of the ground floor, and not from a window; in monte cristo’s opinion, the villains sought his life, not his money.
Perplexity: 1111024512.0000

Sentence: it would be his bedroom they would attack, and they must reach it by the back staircase, or by the window in the dressing-room.
Perplexity: 423177504.0000

Perplexity: 3018062336.0000

Sentence: 40152m as the last stroke died away, the count thought he heard a slight noise in the dressing-room; this first sound, or rather this first grinding, was followed by a second, then a third; at the fourth, the count knew what to expect.
Perplexity: 215263648.0000

Sentence: a firm and well-practised hand was engaged in cutting the four sides of a pane of glass with a diamond.
Perplexity: 791521536.0000

Sentence: the count felt his heart beat more rapidly.
Perplexity: 285856544.0000

Sentence: inured as men may be to danger, forewarned as they may be of peril, they understand, by the fluttering of the heart and the shuddering of the frame, the enormous difference between a dream and a reality, between the project and the execution.
Perplexity: 245880064.0000

Sentence: however, monte cristo only made a sign to apprise ali, who, understanding that danger was approaching from the other side, drew nearer to his master.
Perplexity: 231401440.0000

Perplexity: 2312263936.0000

Perplexity: 23750456.0000

Sentence: he fixed his eyes on that window—he distinguished a shadow in the darkness; then one of the panes became quite opaque, as if a sheet of paper were stuck on the outside, then the square cracked without falling.
Perplexity: 470192512.0000

Sentence: through the opening an arm was passed to find the fastening, then a second; the window turned on its hinges, and a man entered.

Perplexity: 35116372.0000

Sentence: “that’s a daring rascal,” whispered the count.

Sentence: at that moment ali touched him slightly on the shoulder.
Perplexity: 74029920.0000

Sentence: he turned; ali pointed to the window of the room in which they were, facing the street.
Perplexity: 294827680.0000

Sentence: “i see!” said he, “there are two of them; one does the work while the other stands guard.” he made a sign to ali not to lose sight of the man in the street, and turned to the one in the dressing-room.
Perplexity: 1028011968.0000

Sentence: the glass-cutter had entered, and was feeling his way, his arms stretched out before him.
Perplexity: 607574336.0000

Sentence: at last he appeared to have made himself familiar with his surroundings.
Perplexity: 207363216.0000

Sentence: there were two doors; he bolted them both.
Perplexity: 114365568.0000

Sentence: when he drew near to the bedroom door, monte cristo expected that he was coming in, and raised one of his pistols; but he simply heard the sound of the bolts sliding in their copper rings.
Perplexity: 93803464.0000

Sentence: it was only a precaution.
Perplexity: 1345191296.0000

Sentence: the nocturnal visitor, ignorant of the fact that the count had removed the staples, might now think himself at home, and pursue his purpose with full security.
Perplexity: 129616656.0000

Sentence: alone and free to act as he wished, the man then drew from his pocket something which the count could not discern, placed it on a stand, then went straight to the secretaire, felt the lock, and contrary to his expectation found that the key was missing.
Perplexity: 3503872768.0000

Sentence: but the glass-cutter was a prudent man who had provided for all emergencies.
Perplexity: 767296320.0000

Sentence: the count soon heard the rattling of a bunch of skeleton keys, such as the locksmith brings when called to force a lock, and which thieves call nightingales, doubtless from the music of their nightly song when they grind against the bolt.
Perplexity: 475535360.0000

Sentence: “ah, ha,” whispered monte cristo with a smile of disappointment, “he is only a thief.” but the man in the dark could not find the right key.
Perplexity: 167210960.0000

Sentence: he reached the instrument he had placed on the stand, touched a spring, and immediately a pale light, just bright enough to render objects distinct, was reflected on his hands and countenance.
Perplexity: 82645904.0000

Sentence: “by heavens,” exclaimed monte cristo, starting back, “it is——” ali raised his hatchet.
Perplexity: 31050910.0000

Sentence: “don’t stir,” whispered monte cristo, “and put down your hatchet; we shall require no arms.” 40154m then he added some words in a low tone, for the exclamation which surprise had drawn from the count, faint as it had been, had startled the man who remained in the pose of the old knife-grinder.
Perplexity: 470898816.0000

Sentence: it was an order the count had just given, for immediately ali went noiselessly, and returned, bearing a black dress and a three-cornered hat.
Perplexity: 178019568.0000

Sentence: meanwhile monte cristo had rapidly taken off his greatcoat, waistcoat, and shirt, and one might distinguish by the glimmering through the open panel that he wore a pliant tunic of steel mail, of which the last in france, where daggers are no longer dreaded, was worn by king louis xvi., who feared the dagger at his breast, and whose head was cleft with a hatchet.
Perplexity: 99279752.0000

Sentence: the tunic soon disappeared under a long cassock, as did his hair under a priest’s wig; the three-cornered hat over this effectually transformed the count into an abbé.
Perplexity: 108614656.0000

Perplexity: 812801088.0000

Sentence: and when the jeweller johannes had just paid you 45,000 francs for the diamond i had given you, and you killed him to get the diamond and the money both, was that also poverty?” “pardon, reverend sir,” said caderousse; “you have saved my life once, save me again!” “that is but poor encouragement.” “are you alone, reverend sir, or have you there soldiers ready to seize me?” “i am alone,” said the abbé, “and i will again have pity on you, and will let you escape, at the risk of the fresh miseries my weakness may lead to, if you tell me the truth.” “ah, reverend sir,” cried caderousse, clasping his hands, and drawing nearer to monte cristo, “i may indeed say you are my deliverer!” “you mean to say you have been freed from confinement?” “yes, that is true, reverend sir.” “who was your liberator?” “an englishman.” “what was his name?” “lord wilmore.” “i know him; i shall know if you lie.” “ah, reverend sir, i tell you the simple truth.” “was this englishman protecting you?” “no, not me, but a young corsican, my companion.” “what was this young corsican’s name?” “benedetto.” “is that his christian name?” “he had no other; he was a foundling.” “then this young man escaped with you?” “he did.” “in what way?” “we were working at saint-mandrier, near toulon.
Perplexity: 38947384.0000

Sentence: caderousse, terrified, looked at the count.
Perplexity: 905467904.0000

Sentence: “you have lived on the money he has given you.” “true,” said caderousse; “benedetto has become the son of a great lord.” “how can he be the son of a great lord?” “a natural son.” “and what is that great lord’s name?” “the count of monte cristo, the very same in whose house we are.” “benedetto the count’s son?” replied monte cristo, astonished in his turn.
Perplexity: 329903040.0000

Sentence: “well, i should think so, since the count has found him a false father—since the count gives him four thousand francs a month, and leaves him 500,000 francs in his will.” “ah, yes,” said the factitious abbé, who began to understand; “and what name does the young man bear meanwhile?” “andrea cavalcanti.” “is it, then, that young man whom my friend the count of monte cristo has received into his house, and who is going to marry mademoiselle danglars?” “exactly.” “and you suffer that, you wretch!—you, who know his life and his crime?” “why should i stand in a comrade’s way?” said caderousse.

Perplexity: 135526032.0000

Sentence: “i will expose all.” “to whom?” “to m. danglars.” “by heaven!” cried caderousse, drawing from his waistcoat an open knife, and striking the count in the breast, “you shall disclose nothing, reverend sir!” to caderousse’s great astonishment, the knife, instead of piercing the count’s breast, flew back blunted.
Perplexity: 67024760.0000

Sentence: at the same moment the count seized with his left hand the assassin’s wrist, and wrung it with such strength that the knife fell from his stiffened fingers, and caderousse uttered a cry of pain.

Perplexity: 461430688.0000

Sentence: “did he send you?” “yes, sir; he sent for me to his house, gave me money for my journey, procured a horse, and made me promise not to stop till i had reached you, i have come in fifteen hours.” albert opened the letter with fear, uttered a shriek on reading the first line, and seized the paper.

Perplexity: 45541572.0000

Perplexity: 159268000.0000

Perplexity: 136470992.0000

Perplexity: 1438642176.0000

Perplexity: 175226208.0000

Sentence: the count watched him with a feeling of compassion, and when he had completely disappeared, read as follows: “the french officer in the service of ali pasha of yanina alluded to three weeks since in _l’impartial_, who not only surrendered the castle of yanina, but sold his benefactor to the turks, styled himself truly at that time fernand, as our esteemed contemporary states; but he has since added to his christian name a title of nobility and a family name.
Perplexity: 252195840.0000

Perplexity: 2273117952.0000

Sentence: “no,” replied beauchamp, “i have not considered the question; a totally different subject interests me.” “what is it?” “the article relative to morcerf.” “indeed?
Perplexity: 1506985472.0000

Sentence: is it not a curious affair?” “so curious, that i think you are running a great risk of a prosecution for defamation of character.” “not at all; we have received with the information all the requisite proofs, and we are quite sure m. de morcerf will not raise his voice against us; besides, it is rendering a service to one’s country to denounce these wretched criminals who are unworthy of the honor bestowed on them.” beauchamp was thunderstruck.
Perplexity: 707617792.0000

Sentence: “who, then, has so correctly informed you?” asked he; “for my paper, which gave the first information on the subject, has been obliged to stop for want of proof; and yet we are more interested than you in exposing m. de morcerf, as he is a peer of france, and we are of the opposition.” “oh, that is very simple; we have not sought to scandalize.
Perplexity: 163021296.0000

Perplexity: 355061440.0000

Perplexity: 891533696.0000

Perplexity: 231922832.0000

Sentence: the count did not notice the introduction, in which the speaker announced that his communication would be of that vital importance that it demanded the undivided attention of the house; but at the mention of yanina and colonel fernand, he turned so frightfully pale that every member shuddered and fixed his eyes upon him.
Perplexity: 121543608.0000

Perplexity: 340625344.0000

Sentence: “and you, too,” said he, “come, if you like, monsieur; you have a claim, being almost one of the family, and i will give as many rendezvous of that kind as i can find persons willing to accept them.” cavalcanti looked at danglars with a stupefied air, and the latter, making an effort, arose and stepped between the two young men.

Perplexity: 226846080.0000

Sentence: in one respect you are right, for i am ready to quarrel with everyone today; but you have the first claim, m. danglars.” 40212m “sir,” replied danglars, pale with anger and fear, “i warn you, when i have the misfortune to meet with a mad dog, i kill it; and far from thinking myself guilty of a crime, i believe i do society a kindness.

Sentence: i assure you,” cried danglars, with a confidence and security proceeding less from fear than from the interest he really felt for the young man, “i solemnly declare to you, that i should never have thought of writing to yanina, did i know anything of ali pasha’s misfortunes.” “who, then, urged you to write?

Perplexity: 56976668.0000

Sentence: “sir,” said beauchamp, who had not yet spoken, “you appear to accuse the count, who is absent from paris at this moment, and cannot justify himself.” “i accuse no one, sir,” said danglars; “i relate, and i will repeat before the count what i have said to you.” “does the count know what answer you received?” “yes; i showed it to him.” “did he know my father’s christian name was fernand, and his family name mondego?” “yes, i had told him that long since, and i did only what any other would have done in my circumstances, and perhaps less.

Sentence: besides, what was morcerf seeking?
Perplexity: 995617792.0000

Sentence: but monte cristo, without rising, and leaning forward in his chair, merely stretched out his arm and, taking the damp, crushed glove from the clenched hand of the young man: “sir,” said he in a solemn tone, “i consider your glove thrown, and will return it to you wrapped around a bullet.
Perplexity: 680976832.0000

Sentence: “i had been told, but would not credit it, that the grecian slave i have seen with you here in this very box was the daughter of ali pasha.” “it is true, nevertheless.” “then,” said morrel, “i understand it all, and this scene was premeditated.” “how so?” “yes.
Perplexity: 2870937600.0000

Perplexity: 126000728.0000

Sentence: as certainly, maximilian, as i now press your hand, i shall kill him before ten o’clock tomorrow morning.” morrel, in his turn, took monte cristo’s hand in both of his, and he shuddered to feel how cold and steady it was.

Perplexity: 46468068.0000

Sentence: i am happy to see, m. beauchamp, that you are more sober than he was.” “sir,” said m. beauchamp, “albert was wrong, i acknowledge, to betray so much anger, and i come, on my own account, to apologize for him.
Perplexity: 72927384.0000

Perplexity: 422629792.0000

Perplexity: 107948392.0000

Perplexity: 472909600.0000

Perplexity: 25980602.0000

Sentence: edmond, it is not madame de morcerf who is come to you, it is mercédès.” “mercédès is dead, madame,” said monte cristo; “i know no one now of that name.” “mercédès lives, sir, and she remembers, for she alone recognized you when she saw you, and even before she saw you, by your voice, edmond,—by the simple sound of your voice; and from that moment she has followed your steps, watched you, feared you, and she needs not to inquire what hand has dealt the blow which now strikes m. de morcerf.” “fernand, do you mean?” replied monte cristo, with bitter irony; “since we are recalling names, let us remember them all.” monte cristo had pronounced the name of fernand with such an expression of hatred that mercédès felt a thrill of horror run through every vein.
Perplexity: 312348864.0000

Sentence: “you see, edmond, i am not mistaken, and have cause to say, ‘spare my son!’” “and who told you, madame, that i have any hostile intentions against your son?” “no one, in truth; but a mother has twofold sight.

Perplexity: 803417472.0000

Sentence: “oh, for pity’s sake!” “you have seen that he would have thrown his glove in my face if morrel, one of my friends, had not stopped him.” “listen to me, my son has also guessed who you are,—he attributes his father’s misfortunes to you.” “madame, you are mistaken, they are not misfortunes,—it is a punishment.
Perplexity: 112480240.0000

Sentence: it is not i who strike m. de morcerf; it is providence which punishes him.” “and why do you represent providence?” cried mercédès.
Perplexity: 73842920.0000

Sentence: “why do you remember when it forgets?
Perplexity: 451824512.0000

Perplexity: 365742336.0000

Perplexity: 133115528.0000

Sentence: it does not concern me, you are right; and if i have sworn to revenge myself, it is not on the french captain, or the count of morcerf, but on the fisherman fernand, the husband of mercédès the catalane.” “ah, sir!” cried the countess, “how terrible a vengeance for a fault which fatality made me commit!—for i am the only culprit, edmond, and if you owe revenge to anyone, it is to me, who had not fortitude to bear your absence and my solitude.” “but,” exclaimed monte cristo, “why was i absent?
Perplexity: 73317760.0000

Sentence: and why were you alone?” 40231m “because you had been arrested, edmond, and were a prisoner.” “and why was i arrested?
Perplexity: 101603664.0000

Perplexity: 741903936.0000

Sentence: but i will tell you.
Perplexity: 116093480.0000

Sentence: i was arrested and became a prisoner because, under the arbor of la réserve, the day before i was to marry you, a man named danglars wrote this letter, which the fisherman fernand himself posted.” monte cristo went to a secretaire, opened a drawer by a spring, from which he took a paper which had lost its original color, and the ink of which had become of a rusty hue—this he placed in the hands of mercédès.
Perplexity: 237190976.0000

Sentence: it was danglars’ letter to the king’s attorney, which the count of monte cristo, disguised as a clerk from the house of thomson & french, had taken from the file against edmond dantès, on the day he had paid the two hundred thousand francs to m. de boville.
Perplexity: 2869804288.0000

Sentence: mercédès read with terror the following lines: “the king’s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion that one edmond dantès, second in command on board the _pharaon_, this day arrived from smyrna, after having touched at naples and porto-ferrajo, is the bearer of a letter from murat to the usurper, and of another letter from the usurper to the bonapartist club in paris.
Perplexity: 659050496.0000

Sentence: ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the above-mentioned edmond dantès, who either carries the letter for paris about with him, or has it at his father’s abode.
Perplexity: 282350624.0000

Sentence: should it not be found in possession of either father or son, then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said dantès on board the _pharaon_.” “how dreadful!” said mercédès, passing her hand across her brow, moist with perspiration; “and that letter——” “i bought it for two hundred thousand francs, madame,” said monte cristo; “but that is a trifle, since it enables me to justify myself to you.” “and the result of that letter——” “you well know, madame, was my arrest; but you do not know how long that arrest lasted.
Perplexity: 63303396.0000

Sentence: you do not know that i remained for fourteen years within a quarter of a league of you, in a dungeon in the château d’if.
Perplexity: 686470976.0000

Sentence: you do not know that every day of those fourteen years i renewed the vow of vengeance which i had made the first day; and yet i was not aware that you had married fernand, my calumniator, and that my father had died of hunger!” “can it be?” cried mercédès, shuddering.
Perplexity: 168822240.0000

Sentence: “that is what i heard on leaving my prison fourteen years after i had entered it; and that is why, on account of the living mercédès and my deceased father, i have sworn to revenge myself on fernand, and—i have revenged myself.” “and you are sure the unhappy fernand did that?” “i am satisfied, madame, that he did what i have told you; besides, that is not much more odious than that a frenchman by adoption should pass over to the english; that a spaniard by birth should have fought against the spaniards; that a stipendiary of ali should have betrayed and murdered ali.
Perplexity: 258598848.0000

Sentence: compared with such things, what is the letter you have just read?—a lover’s deception, which the woman who has married that man ought certainly to forgive; but not so the lover who was to have married her.
Perplexity: 140811648.0000

Sentence: well, the french did not avenge themselves on the traitor, the spaniards did not shoot the traitor, ali in his tomb left the traitor unpunished; but i, betrayed, sacrificed, buried, have risen from my tomb, by the grace of god, to punish that man.
Perplexity: 132727384.0000

Sentence: he sends me for that purpose, and here i am.” the poor woman’s head and arms fell; her legs bent under her, and she fell on her knees.
Perplexity: 316153760.0000

Sentence: “forgive, edmond, forgive for my sake, who love you still!” the dignity of the wife checked the fervor of the lover and the mother.
Perplexity: 96498352.0000

Sentence: her forehead almost touched the carpet, when the count sprang forward and raised her.
Perplexity: 67047520.0000

Sentence: then seated on a chair, she looked at the manly countenance of monte cristo, on which grief and hatred still impressed a threatening expression.
Perplexity: 714755584.0000

Sentence: “not crush that accursed race?” murmured he; “abandon my purpose at the moment of its accomplishment?
Perplexity: 290738848.0000

Sentence: impossible, madame, impossible!” “edmond,” said the poor mother, who tried every means, “when i call you edmond, why do you not call me mercédès?” “mercédès!” repeated monte cristo; “mercédès!
Perplexity: 52807896.0000

Sentence: well yes, you are right; that name has still its charms, and this is the first time for a long period that i have pronounced it so distinctly.
Perplexity: 2559081472.0000

Sentence: oh, mercédès, i have uttered your name with the sigh of melancholy, with the groan of sorrow, with the last effort of despair; i have uttered it when frozen with cold, crouched on the straw in my dungeon; i have uttered it, consumed with heat, rolling on the stone floor of my prison.
Perplexity: 141520048.0000

Sentence: mercédès, i must revenge myself, for i suffered fourteen years,—fourteen years i wept, i cursed; now i tell you, mercédès, i must revenge myself.” the count, fearing to yield to the entreaties of her he had so ardently loved, called his sufferings to the assistance of his hatred.
Perplexity: 107363792.0000

Sentence: “revenge yourself, then, edmond,” cried the poor mother; “but let your vengeance fall on the culprits,—on him, on me, but not on my son!” “it is written in the good book,” said monte cristo, “that the sins of the fathers shall fall upon their children to the third and fourth generation.
Perplexity: 466158944.0000

Sentence: since god himself dictated those words to his prophet, why should i seek to make myself better than god?” “edmond,” continued mercédès, with her arms extended towards the count, “since i first knew you, i have adored your name, have respected your memory.
Perplexity: 122075648.0000

Sentence: edmond, my friend, do not compel me to tarnish that noble and pure image reflected incessantly on the mirror of my heart.
Perplexity: 470131520.0000

Sentence: edmond, if you knew all the prayers i have addressed to god for you while i thought you were living and since i have thought you must be dead!

Perplexity: 1479019136.0000

Sentence: i imagined your dead body buried at the foot of some gloomy tower, or cast to the bottom of a pit by hateful jailers, and i wept!
Perplexity: 277957248.0000

Sentence: what could i do for you, edmond, besides pray and weep?
Perplexity: 37091110912.0000

Sentence: listen; for ten years i dreamed each night the same dream.
Perplexity: 91635752.0000

Sentence: i had been told that you had endeavored to escape; that you had taken the place of another prisoner; that you had slipped into the winding sheet of a dead body; that you had been thrown alive from the top of the château d’if, and that the cry you uttered as you dashed upon the rocks first revealed to your jailers that they were your murderers.
Perplexity: 29781452.0000

Sentence: well, edmond, i swear to you, by the head of that son for whom i entreat your pity,—edmond, for ten years i saw every night every detail of that frightful tragedy, and for ten years i heard every night the cry which awoke me, shuddering and cold.
Perplexity: 84204448.0000

Sentence: and i, too, edmond—oh!
Perplexity: 134456736.0000

Sentence: believe me—guilty as i was—oh, yes, i, too, have suffered much!” “have you known what it is to have your father starve to death in your absence?” cried monte cristo, thrusting his hands into his hair; “have you seen the woman you loved giving her hand to your rival, while you were perishing at the bottom of a dungeon?” “no,” interrupted mercédès, “but i have seen him whom i loved on the point of murdering my son.” mercédès uttered these words with such deep anguish, with an accent of such intense despair, that monte cristo could not restrain a sob.
Perplexity: 28434524.0000

Sentence: the lion was daunted; the avenger was conquered.
Perplexity: 2091910784.0000

Sentence: “what do you ask of me?” said he,—“your son’s life?
Perplexity: 218495968.0000

Sentence: well, he shall live!” mercédès uttered a cry which made the tears start from monte cristo’s eyes; but these tears disappeared almost instantaneously, for, doubtless, god had sent some angel to collect them—far more precious were they in his eyes than the richest pearls of guzerat and ophir.
Perplexity: 1316375552.0000

Sentence: “oh,” said she, seizing the count’s hand and raising it to her lips; “oh, thank you, thank you, edmond!

Perplexity: 447495936.0000

Perplexity: 2177991424.0000

Sentence: and why so?
Perplexity: 2144323072.0000

Sentence: who talks of dying?
Perplexity: 1791747968.0000

Sentence: whence have you these ideas of death?” “you do not suppose that, publicly outraged in the face of a whole theatre, in the presence of your friends and those of your son—challenged by a boy who will glory in my forgiveness as if it were a victory—you do not suppose that i can for one moment wish to live.
Perplexity: 2579939840.0000

Perplexity: 1275643648.0000

Sentence: with one word you have crushed it, and i die.” “but the duel will not take place, edmond, since you forgive?” “it will take place,” said monte cristo, in a most solemn tone; “but instead of your son’s blood to stain the ground, mine will flow.” mercédès shrieked, and sprang towards monte cristo, but, suddenly stopping, “edmond,” said she, “there is a god above us, since you live and since i have seen you again; i trust to him from my heart.
Perplexity: 514630592.0000

Sentence: while waiting his assistance i trust to your word; you have said that my son should live, have you not?” “yes, madame, he shall live,” said monte cristo, surprised that without more emotion mercédès had accepted the heroic sacrifice he made for her.

Sentence: mercédès extended her hand to the count.
Perplexity: 588077568.0000

Sentence: “edmond,” said she, and her eyes were wet with tears while looking at him to whom she spoke, “how noble it is of you, how great the action you have just performed, how sublime to have taken pity on a poor woman who appealed to you with every chance against her, alas, i am grown old with grief more than with years, and cannot now remind my edmond by a smile, or by a look, of that mercédès whom he once spent so many hours in contemplating.
Perplexity: 177438208.0000

Sentence: ah, believe me, edmond, as i told you, i too have suffered much; i repeat, it is melancholy to pass one’s life without having one joy to recall, without preserving a single hope; but that proves that all is not yet over.
Perplexity: 118161456.0000

Sentence: no, it is not finished; i feel it by what remains in my heart.
Perplexity: 34774904.0000

Sentence: oh, i repeat it, edmond; what you have just done is beautiful—it is grand; it is sublime.” “do you say so now, mercédès?—then what would you say if you knew the extent of the sacrifice i make to you?
Perplexity: 23466054.0000

Sentence: suppose that the supreme being, after having created the world and fertilized chaos, had paused in the work to spare an angel the tears that might one day flow for mortal sins from her immortal eyes; suppose that when everything was in readiness and the moment had come for god to look upon his work and see that it was good—suppose he had snuffed out the sun and tossed the world back into eternal night—then—even then, mercédès, you could not imagine what i lose in sacrificing my life at this moment.” mercédès looked at the count in a way which expressed at the same time her astonishment, her admiration, and her gratitude.
Perplexity: 62863016.0000

Sentence: monte cristo pressed his forehead on his burning hands, as if his brain could no longer bear alone the weight of its thoughts.

Perplexity: 102734304.0000

Sentence: “edmond,” continued she, “you will see that if my face is pale, if my eyes are dull, if my beauty is gone; if mercédès, in short, no longer resembles her former self in her features, you will see that her heart is still the same.
Perplexity: 111845920.0000

Sentence: adieu, then, edmond; i have nothing more to ask of heaven—i have seen you again, and have found you as noble and as great as formerly you were.

Sentence: the meeting after mercédès had left monte cristo, he fell into profound gloom.
Perplexity: 768997312.0000

Perplexity: 356785760.0000

Sentence: “what?” said he to himself, while the lamp and the wax lights were nearly burnt out, and the servants were waiting impatiently in the anteroom; “what?
Perplexity: 118031936.0000

Sentence: this edifice which i have been so long preparing, which i have reared with so much care and toil, is to be crushed by a single touch, a word, a breath!
Perplexity: 158770880.0000

Sentence: yes, this self, of whom i thought so much, of whom i was so proud, who had appeared so worthless in the dungeons of the château d’if, and whom i had succeeded in making so great, will be but a lump of clay tomorrow.
Perplexity: 147100608.0000

Sentence: alas, it is not the death of the body i regret; for is not the destruction of the vital principle, the repose to which everything is tending, to which every unhappy being aspires,—is not this the repose of matter after which i so long sighed, and which i was seeking to attain by the painful process of starvation when faria appeared in my dungeon?
Perplexity: 96963656.0000

Sentence: what is death for me?
Perplexity: 153329056.0000

Sentence: one step farther into rest,—two, perhaps, into silence.
Perplexity: 223727376.0000

Perplexity: 78145408.0000

Sentence: this burden, almost as heavy as a world, which i had raised, and i had thought to bear to the end, was too great for my strength, and i was compelled to lay it down in the middle of my career.
Perplexity: 38033708.0000

Sentence: oh, shall i then, again become a fatalist, whom fourteen years of despair and ten of hope had rendered a believer in providence?
Perplexity: 26578104.0000

Sentence: “and all this—all this, because my heart, which i thought dead, was only sleeping; because it has awakened and has begun to beat again, because i have yielded to the pain of the emotion excited in my breast by a woman’s voice.
Perplexity: 256586416.0000

Sentence: “yet,” continued the count, becoming each moment more absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow, which mercédès had accepted, “yet, it is impossible that so noble-minded a woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when i am in the prime of life and strength; it is impossible that she can carry to such a point maternal love, or rather delirium.
Perplexity: 349348768.0000

Sentence: there are virtues which become crimes by exaggeration.
Perplexity: 267611888.0000

Sentence: no, she must have conceived some pathetic scene; she will come and throw herself between us; and what would be sublime here will there appear ridiculous.” the blush of pride mounted to the count’s forehead as this thought passed through his mind.
Perplexity: 1031771712.0000

Sentence: “ridiculous?” repeated he; “and the ridicule will fall on me.
Perplexity: 134521888.0000

Sentence: i ridiculous?
Perplexity: 723949632.0000

Sentence: no, i would rather die.” by thus exaggerating to his own mind the anticipated ill-fortune of the next day, to which he had condemned himself by promising mercédès to spare her son, the count at last exclaimed: “folly, folly, folly!—to carry generosity so far as to put myself up as a mark for that young man to aim at.
Perplexity: 198055776.0000

Sentence: he will never believe that my death was suicide; and yet it is important for the honor of my memory,—and this surely is not vanity, but a justifiable pride,—it is important the world should know that i have consented, by my free will, to stop my arm, already raised to strike, and that with the arm which has been so powerful against others i have struck myself.
Perplexity: 3000172544.0000

Sentence: it must be; it shall be.” seizing a pen, he drew a paper from a secret drawer in his desk, and wrote at the bottom of the document (which was no other than his will, made since his arrival in paris) a sort of codicil, clearly explaining the nature of his death.
Perplexity: 1130256896.0000

Sentence: “i do this, oh, my god,” said he, with his eyes raised to heaven, “as much for thy honor as for mine.
Perplexity: 43372688.0000

Perplexity: 898142272.0000

Sentence: let them know, on the contrary, that their punishment, which had been decreed by providence, is only delayed by my present determination, and although they escape it in this world, it awaits them in another, and that they are only exchanging time for eternity.” while he was thus agitated by gloomy uncertainties,—wretched waking dreams of grief,—the first rays of morning pierced his windows, and shone upon the pale blue paper on which he had just inscribed his justification of providence.
Perplexity: 26510008.0000

Sentence: it was just five o’clock in the morning when a slight noise like a stifled sigh reached his ear.
Perplexity: 574269632.0000

Sentence: he turned his head, looked around him, and saw no one; but the sound was repeated distinctly enough to convince him of its reality.
Perplexity: 38050900.0000

Sentence: he arose, and quietly opening the door of the drawing-room, saw haydée, who had fallen on a chair, with her arms hanging down and her beautiful head thrown back.
Perplexity: 7386341888.0000

Perplexity: 157192240.0000

Sentence: the noise of the door did not awaken her, and monte cristo gazed at her with affectionate regret.
Perplexity: 673546624.0000

Sentence: “she remembered that she had a son,” said he; “and i forgot i had a daughter.” then, shaking his head sorrowfully, “poor haydée,” said he; “she wished to see me, to speak to me; she has feared or guessed something.
Perplexity: 556715904.0000

Sentence: oh, i cannot go without taking leave of her; i cannot die without confiding her to someone.” he quietly regained his seat, and wrote under the other lines: “i bequeath to maximilian morrel, captain of spahis,—and son of my former patron, pierre morrel, shipowner at marseilles,—the sum of twenty millions, a part of which may be offered to his sister julie and brother-in-law emmanuel, if he does not fear this increase of fortune may mar their happiness.
Perplexity: 50298612.0000

Sentence: these twenty millions are concealed in my grotto at monte cristo, of which bertuccio knows the secret.
Perplexity: 270530016.0000

Sentence: if his heart is free, and he will marry haydée, the daughter of ali pasha of yanina, whom i have brought up with the love of a father, and who has shown the love and tenderness of a daughter for me, he will thus accomplish my last wish.
Perplexity: 195398832.0000

Sentence: this will has already constituted haydée heiress of the rest of my fortune, consisting of lands, funds in england, austria, and holland, furniture in my different palaces and houses, and which without the twenty millions and the legacies to my servants, may still amount to sixty millions.” 40241m he was finishing the last line when a cry behind him made him start, and the pen fell from his hand.
Perplexity: 2061730944.0000

Sentence: “haydée,” said he, “did you read it?” “oh, my lord,” said she, “why are you writing thus at such an hour?
Perplexity: 289679936.0000

Sentence: why are you bequeathing all your fortune to me?
Perplexity: 938085248.0000

Sentence: are you going to leave me?” “i am going on a journey, dear child,” said monte cristo, with an expression of infinite tenderness and melancholy; “and if any misfortune should happen to me——” the count stopped.
Perplexity: 191228080.0000

Sentence: “well?” asked the young girl, with an authoritative tone the count had never observed before, and which startled him.
Perplexity: 156177936.0000

Sentence: “well, if any misfortune happen to me,” replied monte cristo, “i wish my daughter to be happy.” haydée smiled sorrowfully, and shook her head.
Perplexity: 95287920.0000

Sentence: “do you think of dying, my lord?” said she.
Perplexity: 36756392.0000

Sentence: “the wise man, my child, has said, ‘it is good to think of death.’” “well, if you die,” said she, “bequeath your fortune to others, for if you die i shall require nothing;” and, taking the paper, she tore it in four pieces, and threw it into the middle of the room.
Perplexity: 561125120.0000

Sentence: then, the effort having exhausted her strength, she fell, not asleep this time, but fainting on the floor.
Perplexity: 153289584.0000

Sentence: the count leaned over her and raised her in his arms; and seeing that sweet pale face, those lovely eyes closed, that beautiful form motionless and to all appearance lifeless, the idea occurred to him for the first time, that perhaps she loved him otherwise than as a daughter loves a father.
Perplexity: 213090400.0000

Sentence: “alas,” murmured he, with intense suffering, “i might, then, have been happy yet.” then he carried haydée to her room, resigned her to the care of her attendants, and returning to his study, which he shut quickly this time, he again copied the destroyed will.
Perplexity: 60514652.0000

Sentence: as he was finishing, the sound of a cabriolet entering the yard was heard.

Perplexity: 98790328.0000

Sentence: i need to see you strong in your courageous assurance, to recover myself.” monte cristo could not resist this proof of affection; he not only extended his hand to the young man, but flew to him with open arms.
Perplexity: 351355488.0000

Sentence: “morrel,” said he, “it is a happy day for me, to feel that i am beloved by such a man as you.
Perplexity: 152978512.0000

Sentence: good-morning, emmanuel; you will come with me then, maximilian?” “did you doubt it?” said the young captain.
Perplexity: 52869272.0000

Sentence: “but if i were wrong——” “i watched you during the whole scene of that challenge yesterday; i have been thinking of your firmness all night, and i said to myself that justice must be on your side, or man’s countenance is no longer to be relied on.” “but, morrel, albert is your friend?” “simply an acquaintance, sir.” “you met on the same day you first saw me?” “yes, that is true; but i should not have recollected it if you had not reminded me.” “thank you, morrel.” then ringing the bell once, “look.” said he to ali, who came immediately, “take that to my solicitor.
Perplexity: 103930440.0000

Sentence: it is my will, morrel.
Perplexity: 412982912.0000

Sentence: when i am dead, you will go and examine it.” “what?” said morrel, “you dead?” “yes; must i not be prepared for everything, dear friend?
Perplexity: 72953264.0000

Sentence: but what did you do yesterday after you left me?” “i went to tortoni’s, where, as i expected, i found beauchamp and château-renaud.
Perplexity: 43583572.0000

Sentence: i own i was seeking them.” “why, when all was arranged?” “listen, count; the affair is serious and unavoidable.” “did you doubt it!” “no; the offence was public, and everyone is already talking of it.” “well?” “well, i hoped to get an exchange of arms,—to substitute the sword for the pistol; the pistol is blind.” “have you succeeded?” asked monte cristo quickly, with an imperceptible gleam of hope.
Perplexity: 650917696.0000

Sentence: “no; for your skill with the sword is so well known.” “ah?—who has betrayed me?” “the skilful swordsman whom you have conquered.” “and you failed?” “they positively refused.” “morrel,” said the count, “have you ever seen me fire a pistol?” “never.” “well, we have time; look.” monte cristo took the pistols he held in his hand when mercédès entered, and fixing an ace of clubs against the iron plate, with four shots he successively shot off the four sides of the club.
Perplexity: 57276088.0000

Sentence: at each shot morrel turned pale.

Perplexity: 31071054.0000

Sentence: “look, emmanuel.” then turning towards monte cristo, “count,” said he, “in the name of all that is dear to you, i entreat you not to kill albert!—the unhappy youth has a mother.” “you are right,” said monte cristo; “and i have none.” these words were uttered in a tone which made morrel shudder.
Perplexity: 2299755008.0000

Sentence: “you are the offended party, count.” “doubtless; what does that imply?” “that you will fire first.” “i fire first?” “oh, i obtained, or rather claimed that; we had conceded enough for them to yield us that.” “and at what distance?” “twenty paces.” a smile of terrible import passed over the count’s lips.
Perplexity: 39535220.0000

Sentence: “morrel,” said he, “do not forget what you have just seen.” “the only chance for albert’s safety, then, will arise from your emotion.” “i suffer from emotion?” said monte cristo.
Perplexity: 255841168.0000

Sentence: “or from your generosity, my friend; to so good a marksman as you are, i may say what would appear absurd to another.” “what is that?” “break his arm—wound him—but do not kill him.” “i will tell you, morrel,” said the count, “that i do not need entreating to spare the life of m. de morcerf; he shall be so well spared, that he will return quietly with his two friends, while i——” “and you?” “that will be another thing; i shall be brought home.” “no, no,” cried maximilian, quite unable to restrain his feelings.
Perplexity: 138292384.0000

Perplexity: 66321140.0000

Perplexity: 705729472.0000

Perplexity: 163901760.0000

Perplexity: 327347552.0000

Sentence: he returned thus, formidable and implacable, advancing with his arms crossed on his breast, towards the general, who could not understand why he had disappeared, but who on seeing him again, and feeling his teeth chatter and his legs sink under him, drew back, and only stopped when he found a table to support his clenched hand.

Sentence: he stopped at a short distance from the house and alighted.
Perplexity: 1570140416.0000

Perplexity: 193567856.0000

Perplexity: 1817057408.0000

Perplexity: 171712208.0000

Sentence: we may easily understand how eagerly the particulars were asked for, given, and received; and morrel could read an indescribable joy in the eyes of his beloved, when she knew that the termination of this affair was as happy as it was unexpected.

Sentence: from valentine the young man looked towards noirtier.
Perplexity: 58717620.0000

Sentence: “but,” said morrel, “i thought this mixture, of which you now take four spoonfuls, was prepared for m. noirtier?” “i know it is very bitter,” said valentine; “so bitter, that all i drink afterwards appears to have the same taste.” noirtier looked inquiringly at his granddaughter.

Sentence: do you understand me?
Perplexity: 1088245504.0000

Perplexity: 26101546.0000

Sentence: “unhappy man,” cried he, wringing his hands in his turn; “you love valentine,—that daughter of an accursed race!” never had morrel witnessed such an expression—never had so terrible an eye flashed before his face—never had the genius of terror he had so often seen, either on the battle-field or in the murderous nights of algeria, shaken around him more dreadful fire.

Perplexity: 23606524.0000

Sentence: i, who was looking on, an eager and curious spectator,—i, who was watching the working of this mournful tragedy,—i, who like a wicked angel was laughing at the evil men committed protected by secrecy (a secret is easily kept by the rich and powerful), i am in my turn bitten by the serpent whose tortuous course i was watching, and bitten to the heart!” morrel groaned.
Perplexity: 47989600.0000

Sentence: “come, come,” continued the count, “complaints are unavailing, be a man, be strong, be full of hope, for i am here and will watch over you.” morrel shook his head sorrowfully.

Perplexity: 141642656.0000

Sentence: listen, morrel—it is noon; if valentine is not now dead, she will not die.” “how so?” cried morrel, “when i left her dying?” monte cristo pressed his hands to his forehead.

Perplexity: 237915920.0000

Sentence: “i can do much for you, my friend,” replied the count.
Perplexity: 25678604.0000

Perplexity: 99979048.0000

Perplexity: 205403664.0000

Sentence: at last d’avrigny slowly uttered these words: “she is still alive!” “still?” cried villefort; “oh, doctor, what a dreadful word is that.” “yes,” said the physician, “i repeat it; she is still alive, and i am astonished at it.” “but is she safe?” asked the father.
Perplexity: 45655592.0000

Sentence: “yes, since she lives.” at that moment d’avrigny’s glance met noirtier’s eye.
Perplexity: 151725792.0000

Sentence: it glistened with such extraordinary joy, so rich and full of thought, that the physician was struck.
Perplexity: 590010048.0000

Perplexity: 59707964.0000

Sentence: “sir,” said d’avrigny to villefort, “call mademoiselle valentine’s maid, if you please.” villefort went himself to find her; and d’avrigny approached noirtier.

Sentence: “have you something to tell me?” asked he.
Perplexity: 36376288.0000

Perplexity: 339345248.0000

Sentence: “what is the matter, then, with this dear child?
Perplexity: 286261408.0000

Perplexity: 166607040.0000

Sentence: d’avrigny continued to look at noirtier; he saw the eyes of the old man dilate and become round, his cheeks turn pale and tremble; the perspiration stood in drops upon his forehead.

Perplexity: 119691672.0000

Perplexity: 39514264.0000

Perplexity: 251022448.0000

Sentence: then, having renewed his injunction not to give valentine anything, he went down again to noirtier, shut the doors carefully, and after convincing himself that no one was listening: “do you,” said he, “know anything of this young lady’s illness?” “yes,” said the old man.
Perplexity: 285260160.0000

Sentence: “we have no time to lose; i will question, and do you answer me.” noirtier made a sign that he was ready to answer.
Perplexity: 878004736.0000

Sentence: “yes,” replied the old man.
Perplexity: 551408704.0000

Sentence: “do you think he died a natural death?” a sort of smile was discernible on the motionless lips of noirtier.
Perplexity: 241207104.0000

Sentence: “then you have thought that barrois was poisoned?” “yes.” “do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him?” “no.” “do you think the same hand which unintentionally struck barrois has now attacked valentine?” “yes.” “then will she die too?” asked d’avrigny, fixing his penetrating gaze on noirtier.
Perplexity: 30857788.0000

Sentence: he watched the effect of this question on the old man.
Perplexity: 126226112.0000

Perplexity: 167695792.0000

Sentence: “ah, yes, it is true,” murmured d’avrigny.
Perplexity: 111877072.0000

Sentence: then, turning to noirtier,—“do you hope the assassin will be tried?” “no.” “then you hope the poison will take no effect on valentine?” “yes.” “it is no news to you,” added d’avrigny, “to tell you that an attempt has been made to poison her?” the old man made a sign that he entertained no doubt upon the subject.
Perplexity: 203860000.0000

Perplexity: 34013624.0000

Sentence: “of course.
Perplexity: 115482392.0000

Sentence: i had told you that there was brucine in the mixture i give you.” “yes.” “and by accustoming her to that poison, you have endeavored to neutralize the effect of a similar poison?” noirtier’s joy continued.

Sentence: “and you have succeeded,” exclaimed d’avrigny.

Perplexity: 15227394.0000

Sentence: the dose has been excessive, but she has only been shaken by it; and this time, at any rate, valentine will not die.” a superhuman joy expanded the old man’s eyes, which were raised towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude.

Perplexity: 826883584.0000

Perplexity: 515998784.0000

Sentence: “well,” said he, “let us go to valentine; i will give instructions to everyone, and you, m. de villefort, will yourself see that no one deviates from them.” 40294m at the moment when d’avrigny was returning to valentine’s room, accompanied by villefort, an italian priest, of serious demeanor and calm and firm tone, hired for his use the house adjoining the hotel of m. de villefort.
Perplexity: 27911198720.0000

Sentence: no one knew how the three former tenants of that house left it.
Perplexity: 361616480.0000

Sentence: in this room, at about ten o’clock in the morning, the banker himself had been walking to and fro for some minutes thoughtfully and in evident uneasiness, watching both doors, and listening to every sound.
Perplexity: 1220298624.0000

Sentence: when his patience was exhausted, he called his valet.
Perplexity: 542526656.0000

Sentence: “étienne,” said he, “see why mademoiselle eugénie has asked me to meet her in the drawing-room, and why she makes me wait so long.” having given this vent to his ill-humor, the baron became more calm; mademoiselle danglars had that morning requested an interview with her father, and had fixed on the gilded drawing-room as the spot.
Perplexity: 26116886.0000

Sentence: the singularity of this step, and above all its formality, had not a little surprised the banker, who had immediately obeyed his daughter by repairing first to the drawing-room.

Sentence: étienne soon returned from his errand.
Perplexity: 192983552.0000

Perplexity: 266710976.0000

Sentence: this was one of his parts in the popular comedy he was performing,—a make-up he had adopted and which suited him about as well as the masks worn on the classic stage by paternal actors, who seen from one side, were the image of geniality, and from the other showed lips drawn down in chronic ill-temper.
Perplexity: 1251650688.0000

Sentence: let us hasten to say that in private the genial side descended to the level of the other, so that generally the indulgent man disappeared to give place to the brutal husband and domineering father.
Perplexity: 258317856.0000

Sentence: “why the devil does that foolish girl, who pretends to wish to speak to me, not come into my study?
Perplexity: 2355113984.0000

Sentence: and why on earth does she want to speak to me at all?” he was turning this thought over in his brain for the twentieth time, when the door opened and eugénie appeared, attired in a figured black satin dress, her hair dressed and gloves on, as if she were going to the italian opera.
Perplexity: 283609280.0000

Sentence: “well, eugénie, what is it you want with me?
Perplexity: 327775552.0000

Perplexity: 144766720.0000

Perplexity: 83839064.0000

Sentence: i have chosen the drawing-room, sir, as our place of meeting, in order to avoid the disagreeable impressions and influences of a banker’s study.
Perplexity: 908053504.0000

Sentence: those gilded cashbooks, drawers locked like gates of fortresses, heaps of bank-bills, come from i know not where, and the quantities of letters from england, holland, spain, india, china, and peru, have generally a strange influence on a father’s mind, and make him forget that there is in the world an interest greater and more sacred than the good opinion of his correspondents.
Perplexity: 38317828.0000

Sentence: i have, therefore, chosen this drawing-room, where you see, smiling and happy in their magnificent frames, your portrait, mine, my mother’s, and all sorts of rural landscapes and touching pastorals.
Perplexity: 330624928.0000

Sentence: i rely much on external impressions; perhaps, with regard to you, they are immaterial, but i should be no artist if i had not some fancies.” “very well,” replied m. danglars, who had listened to all this preamble with imperturbable coolness, but without understanding a word, since like every man burdened with thoughts of the past, he was occupied with seeking the thread of his own ideas in those of the speaker.
Perplexity: 390363520.0000

Sentence: “there is, then, the second point cleared up, or nearly so,” said eugénie, without the least confusion, and with that masculine pointedness which distinguished her gesture and her language; “and you appear satisfied with the explanation.

Sentence: now, let us return to the first.
Perplexity: 43634980.0000

Sentence: you ask me why i have requested this interview; i will tell you in two words, sir; i will not marry count andrea cavalcanti.” danglars leaped from his chair and raised his eyes and arms towards heaven.
Perplexity: 2475153152.0000

Sentence: 40298m “yes, indeed, sir,” continued eugénie, still quite calm; “you are astonished, i see; for since this little affair began, i have not manifested the slightest opposition, and yet i am always sure, when the opportunity arrives, to oppose a determined and absolute will to people who have not consulted me, and things which displease me.
Perplexity: 615287552.0000

Sentence: however, this time, my tranquillity, or passiveness as philosophers say, proceeded from another source; it proceeded from a wish, like a submissive and devoted daughter” (a slight smile was observable on the purple lips of the young girl), “to practice obedience.” “well?” asked danglars.
Perplexity: 1396394496.0000

Sentence: “well, sir,” replied eugénie, “i have tried to the very last and now that the moment has come, i feel in spite of all my efforts that it is impossible.” “but,” said danglars, whose weak mind was at first quite overwhelmed with the weight of this pitiless logic, marking evident premeditation and force of will, “what is your reason for this refusal, eugénie?
Perplexity: 109253560.0000

Sentence: what reason do you assign?” “my reason?” replied the young girl.
Perplexity: 494797408.0000

Sentence: “well, it is not that the man is more ugly, more foolish, or more disagreeable than any other; no, m. andrea cavalcanti may appear to those who look at men’s faces and figures as a very good specimen of his kind.
Perplexity: 249964656.0000

Sentence: it is not, either, that my heart is less touched by him than any other; that would be a schoolgirl’s reason, which i consider quite beneath me.
Perplexity: 352244544.0000

Sentence: i actually love no one, sir; you know it, do you not?
Perplexity: 33125976.0000

Sentence: i do not then see why, without real necessity, i should encumber my life with a perpetual companion.
Perplexity: 352751488.0000

Sentence: has not some sage said, ‘nothing too much’?
Perplexity: 103721312.0000

Sentence: and another, ‘i carry all my effects with me’?
Perplexity: 225429200.0000

Sentence: i have been taught these two aphorisms in latin and in greek; one is, i believe, from phædrus, and the other from bias.
Perplexity: 89812464.0000

Sentence: well, my dear father, in the shipwreck of life—for life is an eternal shipwreck of our hopes—i cast into the sea my useless encumbrance, that is all, and i remain with my own will, disposed to live perfectly alone, and consequently perfectly free.” “unhappy girl, unhappy girl!” murmured danglars, turning pale, for he knew from long experience the solidity of the obstacle he had so suddenly encountered.
Perplexity: 526127776.0000

Sentence: “unhappy girl,” replied eugénie, “unhappy girl, do you say, sir?
Perplexity: 78975376.0000

Sentence: no, indeed; the exclamation appears quite theatrical and affected.
Perplexity: 410547456.0000

Sentence: happy, on the contrary, for what am i in want of?
Perplexity: 303731424.0000

Sentence: it is something to be well received.
Perplexity: 112019072.0000

Sentence: i like a favorable reception; it expands the countenance, and those around me do not then appear so ugly.
Perplexity: 228817200.0000

Sentence: i possess a share of wit, and a certain relative sensibility, which enables me to draw from life in general, for the support of mine, all i meet with that is good, like the monkey who cracks the nut to get at its contents.
Perplexity: 607318272.0000

Sentence: i am rich, for you have one of the first fortunes in france.
Perplexity: 492956768.0000

Sentence: i am your only daughter, and you are not so exacting as the fathers of the porte saint-martin and gaîté, who disinherit their daughters for not giving them grandchildren.
Perplexity: 256312000.0000

Sentence: besides, the provident law has deprived you of the power to disinherit me, at least entirely, as it has also of the power to compel me to marry monsieur this or monsieur that.
Perplexity: 410347040.0000

Sentence: and so—being, beautiful, witty, somewhat talented, as the comic operas say, and rich—and that is happiness, sir—why do you call me unhappy?” danglars, seeing his daughter smiling, and proud even to insolence, could not entirely repress his brutal feelings, but they betrayed themselves only by an exclamation.
Perplexity: 763321536.0000

Sentence: under the fixed and inquiring gaze levelled at him from under those beautiful black eyebrows, he prudently turned away, and calmed himself immediately, daunted by the power of a resolute mind.
Perplexity: 2444301824.0000

Sentence: “truly, my daughter,” replied he with a smile, “you are all you boast of being, excepting one thing; i will not too hastily tell you which, but would rather leave you to guess it.” eugénie looked at danglars, much surprised that one flower of her crown of pride, with which she had so superbly decked herself, should be disputed.
Perplexity: 171139680.0000

Sentence: “my daughter,” continued the banker, “you have perfectly explained to me the sentiments which influence a girl like you, who is determined she will not marry; now it remains for me to tell you the motives of a father like me, who has decided that his daughter shall marry.” eugénie bowed, not as a submissive daughter, but as an adversary prepared for a discussion.
Perplexity: 190739936.0000

Sentence: “my daughter,” continued danglars, “when a father asks his daughter to choose a husband, he has always some reason for wishing her to marry.
Perplexity: 136758416.0000

Sentence: some are affected with the mania of which you spoke just now, that of living again in their grandchildren.
Perplexity: 138191136.0000

Sentence: this is not my weakness, i tell you at once; family joys have no charm for me.
Perplexity: 3521218048.0000

Sentence: i may acknowledge this to a daughter whom i know to be philosophical enough to understand my indifference, and not to impute it to me as a crime.” “this is not to the purpose,” said eugénie; “let us speak candidly, sir; i admire candor.” “oh,” said danglars, “i can, when circumstances render it desirable, adopt your system, although it may not be my general practice.
Perplexity: 155496384.0000

Perplexity: 1356424576.0000

Sentence: i have proposed to you to marry, not for your sake, for indeed i did not think of you in the least at the moment (you admire candor, and will now be satisfied, i hope); but because it suited me to marry you as soon as possible, on account of certain commercial speculations i am desirous of entering into.” eugénie became uneasy.
Perplexity: 250972688.0000

Sentence: there one may learn, for instance, what, out of regard to your nervous susceptibility, i will inform you of in the drawing-room, namely, that the credit of a banker is his physical and moral life; that credit sustains him as breath animates the body; and m. de monte cristo once gave me a lecture on that subject, which i have never forgotten.
Perplexity: 57765620.0000

Sentence: well, within a week i am to deposit four millions for my share; the four millions, i promise you, will produce ten or twelve.” “but during my visit to you the day before yesterday, sir, which you appear to recollect so well,” replied eugénie, “i saw you arranging a deposit—is not that the term?—of five millions and a half; you even pointed it out to me in two drafts on the treasury, and you were astonished that so valuable a paper did not dazzle my eyes like lightning.” “yes, but those five millions and a half are not mine, and are only a proof of the great confidence placed in me; my title of popular banker has gained me the confidence of charitable institutions, and the five millions and a half belong to them; at any other time i should not have hesitated to make use of them, but the great losses i have recently sustained are well known, and, as i told you, my credit is rather shaken.
Perplexity: 80933384.0000

Perplexity: 18646286.0000

Sentence: are not your name, your social position, and your merit sufficient?” “no,” said andrea,—“no; it is useless for you to say so, count.
Perplexity: 38771208.0000

Sentence: i maintain that the position of a man like you has done more than my name, my social position, and my merit.” “you are completely mistaken, sir,” said monte cristo coldly, who felt the perfidious manœuvre of the young man, and understood the bearing of his words; “you only acquired my protection after the influence and fortune of your father had been ascertained; for, after all, who procured for me, who had never seen either you or your illustrious father, the pleasure of your acquaintance?—two of my good friends, lord wilmore and the abbé busoni.

Perplexity: 150885984.0000

Sentence: then, arousing from his reverie: “now, sir, i have one request to make to you, which you will understand, even if it should be disagreeable to you.” “proceed,” said monte cristo.

Sentence: but one word more, count.” “what is it?” “advice.” “be careful; advice is worse than a service.” “oh, you can give me this without compromising yourself.” “tell me what it is.” “is my wife’s fortune five hundred thousand livres?” “that is the sum m. danglars himself announced.” “must i receive it, or leave it in the hands of the notary?” “this is the way such affairs are generally arranged when it is wished to do them stylishly: your two solicitors appoint a meeting, when the contract is signed, for the next or the following day; then they exchange the two portions, for which they each give a receipt; then, when the marriage is celebrated, they place the amount at your disposal as the chief member of the alliance.” “because,” said andrea, with a certain ill-concealed uneasiness, “i thought i heard my father-in-law say that he intended embarking our property in that famous railway affair of which you spoke just now.” “well,” replied monte cristo, “it will be the way, everybody says, of trebling your fortune in twelve months.
Perplexity: 205923024.0000

Sentence: baron danglars is a good father, and knows how to calculate.” “in that case,” said andrea, “everything is all right, excepting your refusal, which quite grieves me.” “you must attribute it only to natural scruples under similar circumstances.” “well,” said andrea, “let it be as you wish.
Perplexity: 167395072.0000

Sentence: there were caskets of diamonds, cashmere shawls, valenciennes lace, english veils, and in fact all the tempting things, the bare mention of which makes the hearts of young girls bound with joy, and which is called the _corbeille_.22 now, in passing through this room, andrea proved himself not only to be clever and intelligent, but also provident, for he helped himself to the most valuable of the ornaments before him.
Perplexity: 1034297792.0000

Sentence: furnished with this plunder, andrea leaped with a lighter heart from the window, intending to slip through the hands of the gendarmes.
Perplexity: 444690688.0000

Sentence: tall and well proportioned as an ancient gladiator, and muscular as a spartan, he walked for a quarter of an hour without knowing where to direct his steps, actuated by the sole idea of getting away from the spot where if he lingered he knew that he would surely be taken.
Perplexity: 178231568.0000

Perplexity: 1761323648.0000

Sentence: “am i to be captured?” he cried; “no, not if i can use more activity than my enemies.
Perplexity: 5506176000.0000

Sentence: my safety is now a mere question of speed.” at this moment he saw a cab at the top of the faubourg poissonnière.
Perplexity: 320448992.0000

Sentence: the dull driver, smoking his pipe, was plodding along toward the limits of the faubourg saint-denis, where no doubt he ordinarily had his station.
Perplexity: 219959888.0000

Sentence: “ho, friend!” said benedetto.
Perplexity: 225706704.0000

Sentence: “is your horse tired?” “tired?
Perplexity: 124356888.0000

Sentence: oh, yes, tired enough—he has done nothing the whole of this blessed day!
Perplexity: 234984064.0000

Sentence: four wretched fares, and twenty sous over, making in all seven francs, are all that i have earned, and i ought to take ten to the owner.” “will you add these twenty francs to the seven you have?” “with pleasure, sir; twenty francs are not to be despised.
Perplexity: 225660208.0000

Sentence: tell me what i am to do for this.” “a very easy thing, if your horse isn’t tired.” “i tell you he’ll go like the wind,—only tell me which way to drive.” “towards the louvres.” “ah, i know the way—you get good sweetened rum over there.” “exactly so; i merely wish to overtake one of my friends, with whom i am going to hunt tomorrow at chapelle-en-serval.
Perplexity: 143348656.0000

Sentence: he should have waited for me here with a cabriolet till half-past eleven; it is twelve, and, tired of waiting, he must have gone on.” “it is likely.” “well, will you try and overtake him?” “nothing i should like better.” “if you do not overtake him before we reach bourget you shall have twenty francs; if not before louvres, thirty.” “and if we do overtake him?” “forty,” said andrea, after a moment’s hesitation, at the end of which he remembered that he might safely promise.
Perplexity: 557061120.0000

Sentence: “that’s all right,” said the man; “hop in, and we’re off!
Perplexity: 43418212.0000

Sentence: who-o-o-pla!” andrea got into the cab, which passed rapidly through the faubourg saint-denis, along the faubourg saint-martin, crossed the barrier, and threaded its way through the interminable villette.
Perplexity: 2144596992.0000

Sentence: they never overtook the chimerical friend, yet andrea frequently inquired of people on foot whom he passed and at the inns which were not yet closed, for a green cabriolet and bay horse; and as there are a great many cabriolets to be seen on the road to the low countries, and as nine-tenths of them are green, the inquiries increased at every step.
Perplexity: 44956860.0000

Sentence: everyone had just seen it pass; it was only five hundred, two hundred, one hundred steps in advance; at length they reached it, but it was not the friend.
Perplexity: 1204968832.0000

Sentence: once the cab was also passed by a calash rapidly whirled along by two post-horses.
Perplexity: 1103815552.0000

Sentence: “ah,” said cavalcanti to himself, “if i only had that britzka, those two good post-horses, and above all the passport that carries them on!” and he sighed deeply.
Perplexity: 154543712.0000

Sentence: the calash contained mademoiselle danglars and mademoiselle d’armilly.
Perplexity: 1483242752.0000

Sentence: “hurry, hurry!” said andrea, “we must overtake him soon.” and the poor horse resumed the desperate gallop it had kept up since leaving the barrier, and arrived steaming at louvres.
Perplexity: 1894991488.0000

Sentence: “certainly,” said andrea, “i shall not overtake my friend, but i shall kill your horse, therefore i had better stop.
Perplexity: 1939134464.0000

Sentence: here are thirty francs; i will sleep at the _cheval rouge_, and will secure a place in the first coach.

Perplexity: 628441088.0000

Sentence: the cabman joyfully pocketed the sum, and turned back on his road to paris.
Perplexity: 1114892288.0000

Sentence: andrea pretended to go towards the hotel of the _cheval rouge_, but after leaning an instant against the door, and hearing the last sound of the cab, which was disappearing from view, he went on his road, and with a lusty stride soon traversed the space of two leagues.
Perplexity: 329890432.0000

Sentence: then he rested; he must be near chapelle-en-serval, where he pretended to be going.
Perplexity: 66291048.0000

Sentence: it was not fatigue that stayed andrea here; it was that he might form some resolution, adopt some plan.
Perplexity: 264607648.0000

Sentence: it would be impossible to make use of a diligence, equally so to engage post-horses; to travel either way a passport was necessary.
Perplexity: 386434272.0000

Sentence: it was still more impossible to remain in the department of the oise, one of the most open and strictly guarded in france; this was quite out of the question, especially to a man like andrea, perfectly conversant with criminal matters.
Perplexity: 238976064.0000

Sentence: he sat down by the side of the moat, buried his face in his hands and reflected.
Perplexity: 262265680.0000

Perplexity: 124664912.0000

Sentence: he threw some dust over the topcoat, which he had found time to unhook from the antechamber and button over his ball costume, and going to chapelle-en-serval he knocked loudly at the door of the only inn in the place.

Sentence: the host opened.
Perplexity: 246454768.0000

Sentence: “my friend,” said andrea, “i was coming from mortefontaine to senlis, when my horse, which is a troublesome creature, stumbled and threw me.
Perplexity: 73354688.0000

Sentence: i must reach compiègne tonight, or i shall cause deep anxiety to my family.
Perplexity: 634505408.0000

Sentence: could you let me hire a horse of you?” an innkeeper has always a horse to let, whether it be good or bad.
Perplexity: 209687920.0000

Sentence: the host called the stable-boy, and ordered him to saddle _le blanc_ then he awoke his son, a child of seven years, whom he ordered to ride before the gentleman and bring back the horse.
Perplexity: 38152720.0000

Sentence: andrea gave the innkeeper twenty francs, and in taking them from his pocket dropped a visiting card.
Perplexity: 510192512.0000

Sentence: this belonged to one of his friends at the café de paris, so that the innkeeper, picking it up after andrea had left, was convinced that he had let his horse to the count of mauléon, 25 rue saint-dominique, that being the name and address on the card.
Perplexity: 91461136.0000

Sentence: _le blanc_ was not a fast animal, but he kept up an easy, steady pace; in three hours and a half andrea had traversed the nine leagues which separated him from compiègne, and four o’clock struck as he reached the place where the coaches stop.
Perplexity: 434560960.0000

Sentence: there is an excellent tavern at compiègne, well remembered by those who have ever been there.
Perplexity: 3048779008.0000

Sentence: andrea, who had often stayed there in his rides about paris, recollected the bell and bottle inn; he turned around, saw the sign by the light of a reflected lamp, and having dismissed the child, giving him all the small coin he had about him, he began knocking at the door, very reasonably concluding that having now three or four hours before him he had best fortify himself against the fatigues of the morrow by a sound sleep and a good supper.
Perplexity: 805659392.0000

Sentence: a waiter opened the door.
Perplexity: 686444800.0000

Sentence: “my friend,” said andrea, “i have been dining at saint-jean-aux-bois, and expected to catch the coach which passes by at midnight, but like a fool i have lost my way, and have been walking for the last four hours in the forest.
Perplexity: 2443420928.0000

Sentence: show me into one of those pretty little rooms which overlook the court, and bring me a cold fowl and a bottle of bordeaux.” the waiter had no suspicions; andrea spoke with perfect composure, he had a cigar in his mouth, and his hands in the pocket of his top coat; his clothes were fashionably made, his chin smooth, his boots irreproachable; he looked merely as if he had stayed out very late, that was all.
Perplexity: 549377408.0000

Sentence: while the waiter was preparing his room, the hostess arose; andrea assumed his most charming smile, and asked if he could have no.
Perplexity: 320116672.0000

Sentence: 3, which he had occupied on his last stay at compiègne.
Perplexity: 122088928.0000

Perplexity: 425294240.0000

Sentence: 3, and while warming his feet and chatting about the last races at chantilly, he waited until they announced his room to be ready.
Perplexity: 575237632.0000

Sentence: andrea had not spoken without cause of the pretty rooms looking out upon the court of the bell hotel, which with its triple galleries like those of a theatre, with the jessamine and clematis twining round the light columns, forms one of the prettiest entrances to an inn that you can imagine.
Perplexity: 99344528.0000

Sentence: the fowl was tender, the wine old, the fire clear and sparkling, and andrea was surprised to find himself eating with as good an appetite as though nothing had happened.
Perplexity: 1458421120.0000

Sentence: then he went to bed and almost immediately fell into that deep sleep which is sure to visit men of twenty years of age, even when they are torn with remorse.
Perplexity: 65357220.0000

Sentence: now, here we are obliged to own that andrea ought to have felt remorse, but that he did not.
Perplexity: 321873216.0000

Sentence: this was the plan which had appealed to him to afford the best chance of his security.
Perplexity: 1624576896.0000

Sentence: before daybreak he would awake, leave the inn after rigorously paying his bill, and reaching the forest, he would, under pretence of making studies in painting, test the hospitality of some peasants, procure himself the dress of a woodcutter and a hatchet, casting off the lion’s skin to assume that of the woodman; then, with his hands covered with dirt, his hair darkened by means of a leaden comb, his complexion embrowned with a preparation for which one of his old comrades had given him the recipe, he intended, by following the wooded districts, to reach the nearest frontier, walking by night and sleeping in the day in the forests and quarries, and only entering inhabited regions to buy a loaf from time to time.
Perplexity: 2065513472.0000

Sentence: once past the frontier, andrea proposed making money of his diamonds; and by uniting the proceeds to ten bank-notes he always carried about with him in case of accident, he would then find himself possessor of about 50,000 livres, which he philosophically considered as no very deplorable condition after all.
Perplexity: 452188320.0000

Sentence: moreover, he reckoned much on the interest of the danglars to hush up the rumor of their own misadventures.
Perplexity: 332656064.0000

Sentence: these were the reasons which, added to the fatigue, caused andrea to sleep so soundly.
Perplexity: 243565824.0000

Sentence: in order that he might wake early he did not close the shutters, but contented himself with bolting the door and placing on the table an unclasped and long-pointed knife, whose temper he well knew, and which was never absent from him.
Perplexity: 31594924.0000

Sentence: about seven in the morning andrea was awakened by a ray of sunlight, which played, warm and brilliant, upon his face.
Perplexity: 757970880.0000

Sentence: in all well-organized brains, the predominating idea—and there always is one—is sure to be the last thought before sleeping, and the first upon waking in the morning.
Perplexity: 214168960.0000

Sentence: andrea had scarcely opened his eyes when his predominating idea presented itself, and whispered in his ear that he had slept too long.
Perplexity: 225883280.0000

Sentence: he jumped out of bed and ran to the window.
Perplexity: 690783040.0000

Sentence: a gendarme was crossing the court.
Perplexity: 208086288.0000

Sentence: a gendarme is one of the most striking objects in the world, even to a man void of uneasiness; but for one who has a timid conscience, and with good cause too, the yellow, blue, and white uniform is really very alarming.
Perplexity: 174122768.0000

Sentence: “why is that gendarme there?” asked andrea of himself.
Perplexity: 426342784.0000

Sentence: then, all at once, he replied, with that logic which the reader has, doubtless, remarked in him, “there is nothing astonishing in seeing a gendarme at an inn; instead of being astonished, let me dress myself.” and the youth dressed himself with a facility his valet de chambre had failed to rob him of during the two months of fashionable life he had led in paris.
Perplexity: 38288824.0000

Sentence: “now then,” said andrea, while dressing himself, “i’ll wait till he leaves, and then i’ll slip away.” 50047m and, saying this, andrea, who had now put on his boots and cravat, stole gently to the window, and a second time lifted up the muslin curtain.
Perplexity: 191519360.0000

Sentence: not only was the first gendarme still there, but the young man now perceived a second yellow, blue, and white uniform at the foot of the staircase, the only one by which he could descend, while a third, on horseback, holding a musket in his fist, was posted as a sentinel at the great street-door which alone afforded the means of egress.
Perplexity: 1223675776.0000

Sentence: the appearance of the third gendarme settled the matter, for a crowd of curious loungers was extended before him, effectually blocking the entrance to the hotel.
Perplexity: 88475552.0000

Sentence: “they’re after me!” was andrea’s first thought.
Perplexity: 70180952.0000

Sentence: “_diable!_” a pallor overspread the young man’s forehead, and he looked around him with anxiety.
Perplexity: 92098696.0000

Sentence: his room, like all those on the same floor, had but one outlet to the gallery in the sight of everybody.
Perplexity: 96303088.0000

Sentence: “i am lost!” was his second thought; and, indeed, for a man in andrea’s situation, an arrest meant the assizes, trial, and death,—death without mercy or delay.
Perplexity: 348864000.0000

Sentence: for a moment he convulsively pressed his head within his hands, and during that brief period he became nearly mad with terror; but soon a ray of hope glimmered in the multitude of thoughts which bewildered his mind, and a faint smile played upon his white lips and pallid cheeks.
Perplexity: 265894240.0000

Sentence: he looked around and saw the objects of his search upon the chimney-piece; they were a pen, ink, and paper.
Perplexity: 96404168.0000

Sentence: with forced composure he dipped the pen in the ink, and wrote the following lines upon a sheet of paper: “i have no money to pay my bill, but i am not a dishonest man; i leave behind me as a pledge this pin, worth ten times the amount.
Perplexity: 1671740544.0000

Sentence: i shall be excused for leaving at daybreak, for i was ashamed.” he then drew the pin from his cravat and placed it on the paper.
Perplexity: 1475691392.0000

Sentence: this done, instead of leaving the door fastened, he drew back the bolts and even placed the door ajar, as though he had left the room, forgetting to close it, and slipping into the chimney like a man accustomed to that kind of gymnastic exercise, after replacing the chimney-board, which represented achilles with deidamia, and effacing the very marks of his feet upon the ashes, he commenced climbing the hollow tunnel, which afforded him the only means of escape left.
Perplexity: 871414720.0000

Sentence: at this precise time, the first gendarme andrea had noticed walked upstairs, preceded by the commissary of police, and supported by the second gendarme who guarded the staircase and was himself reinforced by the one stationed at the door.
Perplexity: 91058000.0000

Sentence: andrea was indebted for this visit to the following circumstances.
Perplexity: 561193600.0000

Sentence: at daybreak, the telegraphs were set at work in all directions, and almost immediately the authorities in every district had exerted their utmost endeavors to arrest the murderer of caderousse.
Perplexity: 561128320.0000

Sentence: compiègne, that royal residence and fortified town, is well furnished with authorities, gendarmes, and commissaries of police; they therefore began operations as soon as the telegraphic despatch arrived, and the bell and bottle being the best-known hotel in the town, they had naturally directed their first inquiries there.
Perplexity: 141168512.0000

Sentence: now, besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the hôtel de ville, which is next door to the bell and bottle, it had been stated by others that a number of travellers had arrived during the night.
Perplexity: 13343774720.0000

Sentence: the sentinel who was relieved at six o’clock in the morning, remembered perfectly that, just as he was taking his post a few minutes past four, a young man arrived on horseback, with a little boy before him.
Perplexity: 1639403008.0000

Sentence: the young man, having dismissed the boy and horse, knocked at the door of the hotel, which was opened, and again closed after his entrance.
Perplexity: 469549024.0000

Sentence: this late arrival had attracted much suspicion, and the young man being no other than andrea, the commissary and gendarme, who was a brigadier, directed their steps towards his room.
Perplexity: 52081484.0000

Sentence: they found the door ajar.
Perplexity: 283962208.0000

Sentence: “oh, oh,” said the brigadier, who thoroughly understood the trick; “a bad sign to find the door open!
Perplexity: 247971184.0000

Sentence: i would rather find it triply bolted.” and, indeed, the little note and pin upon the table confirmed, or rather corroborated, the sad truth.
Perplexity: 108577576.0000

Sentence: andrea had fled.
Perplexity: 76644312.0000

Sentence: we say corroborated, because the brigadier was too experienced to be convinced by a single proof.
Perplexity: 373901120.0000

Sentence: he glanced around, looked in the bed, shook the curtains, opened the closets, and finally stopped at the chimney.
Perplexity: 24238626.0000

Sentence: andrea had taken the precaution to leave no traces of his feet in the ashes, but still it was an outlet, and in this light was not to be passed over without serious investigation.
Perplexity: 969091648.0000

Sentence: the brigadier sent for some sticks and straw, and having filled the chimney with them, set a light to it.
Perplexity: 242723168.0000

Sentence: the fire crackled, and the smoke ascended like the dull vapor from a volcano; but still no prisoner fell down, as they expected.
Perplexity: 30156254.0000

Sentence: the fact was, that andrea, at war with society ever since his youth, was quite as deep as a gendarme, even though he were advanced to the rank of brigadier, and quite prepared for the fire, he had climbed out on the roof and was crouching down against the chimney-pots.
Perplexity: 262885712.0000

Sentence: 50049m at one time he thought he was saved, for he heard the brigadier exclaim in a loud voice, to the two gendarmes, “he is not here!” but venturing to peep, he perceived that the latter, instead of retiring, as might have been reasonably expected upon this announcement, were watching with increased attention.
Perplexity: 484954272.0000

Sentence: it was now his turn to look about him; the hôtel de ville, a massive sixteenth century building, was on his right; anyone could descend from the openings in the tower, and examine every corner of the roof below, and andrea expected momentarily to see the head of a gendarme appear at one of these openings.
Perplexity: 98133776.0000

Sentence: if once discovered, he knew he would be lost, for the roof afforded no chance of escape; he therefore resolved to descend, not through the same chimney by which he had come up, but by a similar one conducting to another room.
Perplexity: 882051648.0000

Sentence: he looked around for a chimney from which no smoke issued, and having reached it, he disappeared through the orifice without being seen by anyone.
Perplexity: 32553366.0000

Sentence: at the same minute, one of the little windows of the hôtel de ville was thrown open, and the head of a gendarme appeared.
Perplexity: 93655256.0000

Sentence: for an instant it remained motionless as one of the stone decorations of the building, then after a long sigh of disappointment the head disappeared.
Perplexity: 3164833280.0000

Sentence: the brigadier, calm and dignified as the law he represented, passed through the crowd, without answering the thousand questions addressed to him, and re-entered the hotel.
Perplexity: 53666516.0000

Sentence: “well?” asked the two gendarmes.
Perplexity: 47659572.0000

Sentence: “well, my boys,” said the brigadier, “the brigand must really have escaped early this morning; but we will send to the villers-coterets and noyon roads, and search the forest, when we shall catch him, no doubt.” the honorable functionary had scarcely expressed himself thus, in that intonation which is peculiar to brigadiers of the gendarmerie, when a loud scream, accompanied by the violent ringing of a bell, resounded through the court of the hotel.
Perplexity: 2066356736.0000

Sentence: “ah, what is that?” cried the brigadier.
Perplexity: 106857544.0000

Sentence: “some traveller seems impatient,” said the host.
Perplexity: 155449824.0000

Sentence: “what number was it that rang?” “number 3.” “run, waiter!” at this moment the screams and ringing were redoubled.
Perplexity: 36082052.0000

Sentence: “aha!” said the brigadier, stopping the servant, “the person who is ringing appears to want something more than a waiter; we will attend upon him with a gendarme.
Perplexity: 98660776.0000

Sentence: who occupies number 3?” “the little fellow who arrived last night in a post-chaise with his sister, and who asked for an apartment with two beds.” the bell here rang for the third time, with another shriek of anguish.
Perplexity: 27619728.0000

Sentence: “follow me, mr. commissary!” said the brigadier; “tread in my steps.” “wait an instant,” said the host; “number 3 has two staircases,—inside and outside.” “good,” said the brigadier.
Perplexity: 96123792.0000

Sentence: “i will take charge of the inside one.
Perplexity: 719051904.0000

Sentence: are the carbines loaded?” “yes, brigadier.” “well, you guard the exterior, and if he attempts to fly, fire upon him; he must be a great criminal, from what the telegraph says.” the brigadier, followed by the commissary, disappeared by the inside staircase, accompanied by the noise which his assertions respecting andrea had excited in the crowd.
Perplexity: 144060192.0000

Sentence: this is what had happened: andrea had very cleverly managed to descend two-thirds of the chimney, but then his foot slipped, and notwithstanding his endeavors, he came into the room with more speed and noise than he intended.
Perplexity: 69974576.0000

Sentence: it would have signified little had the room been empty, but unfortunately it was occupied.
Perplexity: 107912160.0000

Sentence: two ladies, sleeping in one bed, were awakened by the noise, and fixing their eyes upon the spot whence the sound proceeded, they saw a man.
Perplexity: 325541920.0000

Sentence: andrea, as we can see, was surrounded by misfortune.
Perplexity: 1043185536.0000

Sentence: “for pity’s sake,” he cried, pale and bewildered, without seeing whom he was addressing,—“for pity’s sake do not call assistance!
Perplexity: 8569532416.0000

Sentence: save me!—i will not harm you.” “andrea, the murderer!” cried one of the ladies.
Perplexity: 1242045312.0000

Sentence: “eugénie!
Perplexity: 528422784.0000

Sentence: mademoiselle danglars!” exclaimed andrea, stupefied.
Perplexity: 95138104.0000

Sentence: “help, help!” cried mademoiselle d’armilly, taking the bell from her companion’s hand, and ringing it yet more violently.
Perplexity: 64261780.0000

Sentence: “save me, i am pursued!” said andrea, clasping his hands.
Perplexity: 124700824.0000

Perplexity: 53073768.0000

Sentence: “well, conceal me somewhere; you can say you were needlessly alarmed; you can turn their suspicions and save my life!” 50053m the two ladies, pressing closely to one another, and drawing the bedclothes tightly around them, remained silent to this supplicating voice, repugnance and fear taking possession of their minds.
Perplexity: 603839296.0000

Sentence: “well, be it so,” at length said eugénie; “return by the same road you came, and we will say nothing about you, unhappy wretch.” “here he is, here he is!” cried a voice from the landing; “here he is!

Perplexity: 797728000.0000

Sentence: “fly, then!” cried mademoiselle d’armilly, whose pity returned as her fears diminished; “fly!” “or kill yourself!” said eugénie (in a tone which a vestal in the amphitheatre would have used, when urging the victorious gladiator to finish his vanquished adversary).
Perplexity: 140990368.0000

Sentence: andrea shuddered, and looked on the young girl with an expression which proved how little he understood such ferocious honor.
Perplexity: 50079492.0000

Sentence: “kill myself?” he cried, throwing down his knife; “why should i do so?” “why, you said,” answered mademoiselle danglars, “that you would be condemned to die like the worst criminals.” 50055m “bah,” said cavalcanti, crossing his arms, “one has friends.” the brigadier advanced to him, sword in hand.
Perplexity: 96700472.0000

Sentence: “come, come,” said andrea, “sheathe your sword, my fine fellow; there is no occasion to make such a fuss, since i give myself up;” and he held out his hands to be manacled.
Perplexity: 305720320.0000

Sentence: the two girls looked with horror upon this shameful metamorphosis, the man of the world shaking off his covering and appearing as a galley-slave.
Perplexity: 2292607232.0000

Sentence: andrea turned towards them, and with an impertinent smile asked, “have you any message for your father, mademoiselle danglars, for in all probability i shall return to paris?” eugénie covered her face with her hands.
Perplexity: 195262480.0000

Sentence: “oh, oh!” said andrea, “you need not be ashamed, even though you did post after me.
Perplexity: 587336640.0000

Perplexity: 241997424.0000

Perplexity: 455302208.0000

Sentence: “oh, why is not the world a wilderness?” she exclaimed, throwing herself into the arms of mademoiselle d’armilly, her eyes sparkling with the same kind of rage which made nero wish that the roman world had but one neck, that he might sever it at a single blow.

Sentence: the next day they stopped at the hôtel de flandre, at brussels.

Sentence: the same evening andrea was incarcerated in the conciergerie.
Perplexity: 21907340.0000

Sentence: the law we have seen how quietly mademoiselle danglars and mademoiselle d’armilly accomplished their transformation and flight; the fact being that everyone was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think of theirs.
Perplexity: 514300896.0000

Sentence: we will leave the banker contemplating the enormous magnitude of his debt before the phantom of bankruptcy, and follow the baroness, who after being momentarily crushed under the weight of the blow which had struck her, had gone to seek her usual adviser, lucien debray.
Perplexity: 290375872.0000

Sentence: the baroness had looked forward to this marriage as a means of ridding her of a guardianship which, over a girl of eugénie’s character, could not fail to be rather a troublesome undertaking; for in the tacit relations which maintain the bond of family union, the mother, to maintain her ascendancy over her daughter, must never fail to be a model of wisdom and a type of perfection.
Perplexity: 644513408.0000

Sentence: now, madame danglars feared eugénie’s sagacity and the influence of mademoiselle d’armilly; she had frequently observed the contemptuous expression with which her daughter looked upon debray,—an expression which seemed to imply that she understood all her mother’s amorous and pecuniary relationships with the intimate secretary; moreover, she saw that eugénie detested debray, not only because he was a source of dissension and scandal under the paternal roof, but because she had at once classed him in that catalogue of bipeds whom plato endeavors to withdraw from the appellation of men, and whom diogenes designated as animals upon two legs without feathers.
Perplexity: 234654416.0000

Sentence: unfortunately, in this world of ours, each person views things through a certain medium, and so is prevented from seeing in the same light as others, and madame danglars, therefore, very much regretted that the marriage of eugénie had not taken place, not only because the match was good, and likely to insure the happiness of her child, but because it would also set her at liberty.
Perplexity: 70001944.0000

Sentence: she ran therefore to debray, who, after having, like the rest of paris, witnessed the contract scene and the scandal attending it, had retired in haste to his club, where he was chatting with some friends upon the events which served as a subject of conversation for three-fourths of that city known as the capital of the world.
Perplexity: 2396508160.0000

Sentence: at the precise time when madame danglars, dressed in black and concealed in a long veil, was ascending the stairs leading to debray’s apartments, notwithstanding the assurances of the concierge that the young man was not at home, debray was occupied in repelling the insinuations of a friend, who tried to persuade him that after the terrible scene which had just taken place he ought, as a friend of the family, to marry mademoiselle danglars and her two millions.
Perplexity: 207710368.0000

Sentence: debray did not defend himself very warmly, for the idea had sometimes crossed his mind; still, when he recollected the independent, proud spirit of eugénie, he positively rejected it as utterly impossible, though the same thought again continually recurred and found a resting-place in his heart.
Perplexity: 26087710.0000

Sentence: tea, play, and the conversation, which had become interesting during the discussion of such serious affairs, lasted till one o’clock in the morning.
Perplexity: 4689298944.0000

Sentence: meanwhile madame danglars, veiled and uneasy, awaited the return of debray in the little green room, seated between two baskets of flowers, which she had that morning sent, and which, it must be confessed, debray had himself arranged and watered with so much care that his absence was half excused in the eyes of the poor woman.
Perplexity: 309408448.0000

Sentence: at twenty minutes to twelve, madame danglars, tired of waiting, returned home.

Perplexity: 139081184.0000

Sentence: the baroness returned to the hotel with as much caution as eugénie used in leaving it; she ran lightly upstairs, and with an aching heart entered her apartment, contiguous, as we know, to that of eugénie.
Perplexity: 57658188.0000

Sentence: she was fearful of exciting any remark, and believed firmly in her daughter’s innocence and fidelity to the paternal roof.

Perplexity: 117510128.0000

Sentence: she called the maid and questioned her.
Perplexity: 365634912.0000

Sentence: “mademoiselle eugénie,” said the maid, “retired to her apartment with mademoiselle d’armilly; they then took tea together, after which they desired me to leave, saying that they needed me no longer.” since then the maid had been below, and like everyone else she thought the young ladies were in their own room; madame danglars, therefore, went to bed without a shadow of suspicion, and began to muse over the recent events.
Perplexity: 636936512.0000

Sentence: in proportion as her memory became clearer, the occurrences of the evening were revealed in their true light; what she had taken for confusion was a tumult; what she had regarded as something distressing, was in reality a disgrace.
Perplexity: 737195392.0000

Sentence: and then the baroness remembered that she had felt no pity for poor mercédès, who had been afflicted with as severe a blow through her husband and son.
Perplexity: 20910430.0000

Sentence: “eugénie,” she said to herself, “is lost, and so are we.
Perplexity: 2222300160.0000

Sentence: the affair, as it will be reported, will cover us with shame; for in a society such as ours satire inflicts a painful and incurable wound.
Perplexity: 334706688.0000

Sentence: how fortunate that eugénie is possessed of that strange character which has so often made me tremble!” and her glance was turned towards heaven, where a mysterious providence disposes all things, and out of a fault, nay, even a vice, sometimes produces a blessing.
Perplexity: 1224322432.0000

Sentence: and then her thoughts, cleaving through space like a bird in the air, rested on cavalcanti.
Perplexity: 1397177856.0000

Sentence: this andrea was a wretch, a robber, an assassin, and yet his manners showed the effects of a sort of education, if not a complete one; he had been presented to the world with the appearance of an immense fortune, supported by an honorable name.
Perplexity: 1223206784.0000

Sentence: how could she extricate herself from this labyrinth?
Perplexity: 2187976192.0000

Sentence: to whom would she apply to help her out of this painful situation?
Perplexity: 437487520.0000

Sentence: debray, to whom she had run, with the first instinct of a woman towards the man she loves, and who yet betrays her,—debray could but give her advice, she must apply to someone more powerful than he.
Perplexity: 834226176.0000

Sentence: the baroness then thought of m. de villefort.
Perplexity: 23851964.0000

Sentence: it was m. de villefort who had remorselessly brought misfortune into her family, as though they had been strangers.
Perplexity: 188957296.0000

Sentence: but, no; on reflection, the procureur was not a merciless man; and it was not the magistrate, slave to his duties, but the friend, the loyal friend, who roughly but firmly cut into the very core of the corruption; it was not the executioner, but the surgeon, who wished to withdraw the honor of danglars from ignominious association with the disgraced young man they had presented to the world as their son-in-law.
Perplexity: 51581848.0000

Sentence: and since villefort, the friend of danglars, had acted in this way, no one could suppose that he had been previously acquainted with, or had lent himself to, any of andrea’s intrigues.
Perplexity: 182896192.0000

Sentence: villefort’s conduct, therefore, upon reflection, appeared to the baroness as if shaped for their mutual advantage.
Perplexity: 92750064.0000

Sentence: but the inflexibility of the procureur should stop there; she would see him the next day, and if she could not make him fail in his duties as a magistrate, she would, at least, obtain all the indulgence he could allow.
Perplexity: 90126672.0000

Sentence: she would invoke the past, recall old recollections; she would supplicate him by the remembrance of guilty, yet happy days.
Perplexity: 72046272.0000

Sentence: and after this reasoning she slept easily.
Perplexity: 36384892.0000

Sentence: at nine o’clock next morning she arose, and without ringing for her maid or giving the least sign of her activity, she dressed herself in the same simple style as on the previous night; then running downstairs, she left the hotel, walked to the rue de provence, called a cab, and drove to m. de villefort’s house.
Perplexity: 105059904.0000

Sentence: for the last month this wretched house had presented the gloomy appearance of a lazaretto infected with the plague.
Perplexity: 518352416.0000

Sentence: some of the apartments were closed within and without; the shutters were only opened to admit a minute’s air, showing the scared face of a footman, and immediately afterwards the window would be closed, like a gravestone falling on a sepulchre, and the neighbors would say to each other in a low voice, “will there be another funeral today at the procureur’s house?” madame danglars involuntarily shuddered at the desolate aspect of the mansion; descending from the cab, she approached the door with trembling knees, and rang the bell.
Perplexity: 373291136.0000

Sentence: three times did the bell ring with a dull, heavy sound, seeming to participate, in the general sadness, before the concierge appeared and peeped through the door, which he opened just wide enough to allow his words to be heard.
Perplexity: 26206002.0000

Sentence: he saw a lady, a fashionable, elegantly dressed lady, and yet the door remained almost closed.

Perplexity: 158637984.0000

Sentence: and now, what do you want?” “oh, how extraordinary!
Perplexity: 1891813504.0000

Sentence: i shall complain to m. de villefort of the impertinence of his servants.” “madame, this is precaution, not impertinence; no one enters here without an order from m. d’avrigny, or without speaking to the procureur.” “well, i have business with the procureur.” “is it pressing business?” “you can imagine so, since i have not even brought my carriage out yet.
Perplexity: 84383400.0000

Sentence: but enough of this—here is my card, take it to your master.” “madame will await my return?” “yes; go.” the concierge closed the door, leaving madame danglars in the street.
Perplexity: 49870460.0000

Sentence: she had not long to wait; directly afterwards the door was opened wide enough to admit her, and when she had passed through, it was again shut.
Perplexity: 447175104.0000

Sentence: without losing sight of her for an instant, the concierge took a whistle from his pocket as soon as they entered the court, and blew it.
Perplexity: 19121448.0000

Sentence: the valet de chambre appeared on the door-steps.
Perplexity: 1152160256.0000

Sentence: “you will excuse this poor fellow, madame,” he said, as he preceded the baroness, “but his orders are precise, and m. de villefort begged me to tell you that he could not act otherwise.” in the court showing his merchandise, was a tradesman who had been admitted with the same precautions.
Perplexity: 70288256.0000

Sentence: the baroness ascended the steps; she felt herself strongly infected with the sadness which seemed to magnify her own, and still guided by the valet de chambre, who never lost sight of her for an instant, she was introduced to the magistrate’s study.
Perplexity: 97623176.0000

Sentence: preoccupied as madame danglars had been with the object of her visit, the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so insulting, that she began by complaining of it.
Perplexity: 113352264.0000

Sentence: but villefort, raising his head, bowed down by grief, looked up at her with so sad a smile that her complaints died upon her lips.
Perplexity: 1530004736.0000

Sentence: “forgive my servants,” he said, “for a terror i cannot blame them for; from being suspected they have become suspicious.” madame danglars had often heard of the terror to which the magistrate alluded, but without the evidence of her own eyesight she could never have believed that the sentiment had been carried so far.
Perplexity: 104479200.0000

Sentence: “you too, then, are unhappy?” she said.

Perplexity: 249720672.0000

Sentence: “alas, madame,” said the procureur with his imperturbable calmness of manner, “i consider those alone misfortunes which are irreparable.” “and do you suppose this will be forgotten?” “everything will be forgotten, madame,” said villefort.
Perplexity: 876552384.0000

Sentence: “your daughter will be married tomorrow, if not today—in a week, if not tomorrow; and i do not think you can regret the intended husband of your daughter.” madame danglars gazed on villefort, stupefied to find him so almost insultingly calm.
Perplexity: 217569856.0000

Sentence: “am i come to a friend?” she asked in a tone full of mournful dignity.
Perplexity: 1225794560.0000

Sentence: “you know that you are, madame,” said villefort, whose pale cheeks became slightly flushed as he gave her the assurance.
Perplexity: 41601620.0000

Perplexity: 270701376.0000

Sentence: “well, then, be more affectionate, my dear villefort,” said the baroness.
Perplexity: 145903808.0000

Perplexity: 138876800.0000

Sentence: “when i hear misfortunes named, madame,” he said, “i have within the last few months contracted the bad habit of thinking of my own, and then i cannot help drawing up an egotistical parallel in my mind.
Perplexity: 949796864.0000

Sentence: that is the reason that by the side of my misfortunes yours appear to me mere mischances; that is why my dreadful position makes yours appear enviable.
Perplexity: 64618956.0000

Sentence: but this annoys you; let us change the subject.
Perplexity: 339911392.0000

Sentence: you were saying, madame——” “i came to ask you, my friend,” said the baroness, “what will be done with this impostor?” “impostor,” repeated villefort; “certainly, madame, you appear to extenuate some cases, and exaggerate others.
Perplexity: 220018208.0000

Sentence: impostor, indeed!—m.
Perplexity: 103290336.0000

Sentence: andrea cavalcanti, or rather m. benedetto, is nothing more nor less than an assassin!” “sir, i do not deny the justice of your correction, but the more severely you arm yourself against that unfortunate man, the more deeply will you strike our family.
Perplexity: 666905600.0000

Sentence: come, forget him for a moment, and instead of pursuing him, let him go.” “you are too late, madame; the orders are issued.” “well, should he be arrested—do they think they will arrest him?” “i hope so.” “if they should arrest him (i know that sometimes prisons afford means of escape), will you leave him in prison?” the procureur shook his head.
Perplexity: 89574152.0000

Sentence: “at least keep him there till my daughter be married.” “impossible, madame; justice has its formalities.” “what, even for me?” said the baroness, half jesting, half in earnest.

Sentence: “for all, even for myself among the rest,” replied villefort.
Perplexity: 424974752.0000

Perplexity: 58992196.0000

Sentence: villefort looked at her with that piercing glance which reads the secrets of the heart.
Perplexity: 832811264.0000

Sentence: “yes, i know what you mean,” he said; “you refer to the terrible rumors spread abroad in the world, that the deaths which have kept me in mourning for the last three months, and from which valentine has only escaped by a miracle, have not happened by natural means.” “i was not thinking of that,” replied madame danglars quickly.
Perplexity: 110559752.0000

Sentence: “yes, you were thinking of it, and with justice.
Perplexity: 49269996.0000

Sentence: you could not help thinking of it, and saying to yourself, ‘you, who pursue crime so vindictively, answer now, why are there unpunished crimes in your dwelling?’” the baroness became pale.
Perplexity: 123147672.0000

Sentence: “you were saying this, were you not?” “well, i own it.” “i will answer you.” villefort drew his armchair nearer to madame danglars; then resting both hands upon his desk he said in a voice more hollow than usual: “there are crimes which remain unpunished because the criminals are unknown, and we might strike the innocent instead of the guilty; but when the culprits are discovered” (villefort here extended his hand toward a large crucifix placed opposite to his desk)—“when they are discovered, i swear to you, by all i hold most sacred, that whoever they may be they shall die.
Perplexity: 452835648.0000

Sentence: now, after the oath i have just taken, and which i will keep, madame, dare you ask for mercy for that wretch!” “but, sir, are you sure he is as guilty as they say?” “listen; this is his description: ‘benedetto, condemned, at the age of sixteen, for five years to the galleys for forgery.’ he promised well, as you see—first a runaway, then an assassin.” “and who is this wretch?” “who can tell?—a vagabond, a corsican.” “has no one owned him?” “no one; his parents are unknown.” “but who was the man who brought him from lucca?” “another rascal like himself, perhaps his accomplice.” the baroness clasped her hands.

Perplexity: 31421964.0000

Perplexity: 185457408.0000

Perplexity: 58623060.0000

Sentence: “but”’ said madame danglars, resolving to make a last effort, “this young man, though a murderer, is an orphan, abandoned by everybody.” “so much the worse, or rather, so much the better; it has been so ordained that he may have none to weep his fate.” “but this is trampling on the weak, sir.” “the weakness of a murderer!” “his dishonor reflects upon us.” “is not death in my house?” “oh, sir,” exclaimed the baroness, “you are without pity for others, well, then, i tell you they will have no mercy on you!” “be it so!” said villefort, raising his arms to heaven with a threatening gesture.
Perplexity: 32106858.0000

Sentence: “at least, delay the trial till the next assizes; we shall then have six months before us.” “no, madame,” said villefort; “instructions have been given.

Sentence: madame danglars trembled with fear; villefort started with joy.
Perplexity: 731852096.0000

Sentence: “adieu, sir,” she said.
Perplexity: 46308452.0000

Sentence: the apparition as the procureur had told madame danglars, valentine was not yet recovered.
Perplexity: 389642720.0000

Sentence: bowed down with fatigue, she was indeed confined to her bed; and it was in her own room, and from the lips of madame de villefort, that she heard all the strange events we have related; we mean the flight of eugénie and the arrest of andrea cavalcanti, or rather benedetto, together with the accusation of murder pronounced against him.
Perplexity: 169317568.0000

Sentence: but valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the same effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of health.
Perplexity: 983140480.0000

Sentence: indeed, her brain was only the seat of vague ideas, and confused forms, mingled with strange fancies, alone presented themselves before her eyes.
Perplexity: 141711024.0000

Sentence: during the daytime valentine’s perceptions remained tolerably clear, owing to the constant presence of m. noirtier, who caused himself to be carried to his granddaughter’s room, and watched her with his paternal tenderness; villefort also, on his return from the law courts, frequently passed an hour or two with his father and child.
Perplexity: 133951184.0000

Sentence: at six o’clock villefort retired to his study, at eight m. d’avrigny himself arrived, bringing the night draught prepared for the young girl, and then m. noirtier was carried away.
Perplexity: 33800468.0000

Perplexity: 872028224.0000

Sentence: as she went downstairs she gave the keys of valentine’s room to m. de villefort, so that no one could reach the sick-room excepting through that of madame de villefort and little edward.
Perplexity: 282090048.0000

Sentence: every morning morrel called on noirtier to receive news of valentine, and, extraordinary as it seemed, each day found him less uneasy.
Perplexity: 1334147712.0000

Sentence: certainly, though valentine still labored under dreadful nervous excitement, she was better; and moreover, monte cristo had told him when, half distracted, he had rushed to the count’s house, that if she were not dead in two hours she would be saved.
Perplexity: 391929472.0000

Sentence: now four days had elapsed, and valentine still lived.
Perplexity: 211797392.0000

Sentence: the nervous excitement of which we speak pursued valentine even in her sleep, or rather in that state of somnolence which succeeded her waking hours; it was then, in the silence of night, in the dim light shed from the alabaster lamp on the chimney-piece, that she saw the shadows pass and repass which hover over the bed of sickness, and fan the fever with their trembling wings.
Perplexity: 46838324.0000

Sentence: first she fancied she saw her stepmother threatening her, then morrel stretched his arms towards her; sometimes mere strangers, like the count of monte cristo came to visit her; even the very furniture, in these moments of delirium, seemed to move, and this state lasted till about three o’clock in the morning, when a deep, heavy slumber overcame the young girl, from which she did not awake till daylight.
Perplexity: 577252288.0000

Sentence: on the evening of the day on which valentine had learned of the flight of eugénie and the arrest of benedetto,—villefort having retired as well as noirtier and d’avrigny,—her thoughts wandered in a confused maze, alternately reviewing her own situation and the events she had just heard.

Sentence: eleven o’clock had struck.
Perplexity: 19816488.0000

Sentence: the nurse, having placed the beverage prepared by the doctor within reach of the patient, and locked the door, was listening with terror to the comments of the servants in the kitchen, and storing her memory with all the horrible stories which had for some months past amused the occupants of the antechambers in the house of the king’s attorney.
Perplexity: 49527308.0000

Sentence: meanwhile an unexpected scene was passing in the room which had been so carefully locked.
Perplexity: 18153365504.0000

Sentence: ten minutes had elapsed since the nurse had left; valentine, who for the last hour had been suffering from the fever which returned nightly, incapable of controlling her ideas, was forced to yield to the excitement which exhausted itself in producing and reproducing a succession and recurrence of the same fancies and images.
Perplexity: 5165967872.0000

Sentence: the night-lamp threw out countless rays, each resolving itself into some strange form to her disordered imagination, when suddenly by its flickering light valentine thought she saw the door of her library, which was in the recess by the chimney-piece, open slowly, though she in vain listened for the sound of the hinges on which it turned.
Perplexity: 1003707904.0000

Sentence: at any other time valentine would have seized the silken bell-pull and summoned assistance, but nothing astonished her in her present situation.
Perplexity: 3033482752.0000

Perplexity: 139007184.0000

Sentence: from behind the door a human figure appeared, but the girl was too familiar with such apparitions to be alarmed, and therefore only stared, hoping to recognize morrel.
Perplexity: 133385960.0000

Sentence: the figure advanced towards the bed and appeared to listen with profound attention.
Perplexity: 53225320.0000

Sentence: at this moment a ray of light glanced across the face of the midnight visitor.
Perplexity: 3918317824.0000

Sentence: “it is not he,” she murmured, and waited, in the assurance that this was but a dream, for the man to disappear or assume some other form.
Perplexity: 27071002.0000

Sentence: still, she felt her pulse, and finding it throb violently she remembered that the best method of dispelling such illusions was to drink, for a draught of the beverage prepared by the doctor to allay her fever seemed to cause a reaction of the brain, and for a short time she suffered less.
Perplexity: 29710078.0000

Sentence: valentine therefore reached her hand towards the glass, but as soon as her trembling arm left the bed the apparition advanced more quickly towards her, and approached the young girl so closely that she fancied she heard his breath, and felt the pressure of his hand.
Perplexity: 152440544.0000

Sentence: this time the illusion, or rather the reality, surpassed anything valentine had before experienced; she began to believe herself really alive and awake, and the belief that her reason was this time not deceived made her shudder.

Sentence: the pressure she felt was evidently intended to arrest her arm, and she slowly withdrew it.
Perplexity: 100586728.0000

Perplexity: 753327104.0000

Sentence: this did not seem sufficient; the man, or rather the ghost—for he trod so softly that no sound was heard—then poured out about a spoonful into the glass, and drank it.
Perplexity: 56788968.0000

Sentence: valentine witnessed this scene with a sentiment of stupefaction.
Perplexity: 26729602.0000

Sentence: every minute she had expected that it would vanish and give place to another vision; but the man, instead of dissolving like a shadow, again approached her, and said in an agitated voice, “now you may drink.” valentine shuddered.
Perplexity: 615280576.0000

Sentence: it was the first time one of these visions had ever addressed her in a living voice, and she was about to utter an exclamation.
Perplexity: 94419520.0000

Sentence: the man placed his finger on her lips.
Perplexity: 245362864.0000

Sentence: “the count of monte cristo!” she murmured.
Perplexity: 899913600.0000

Sentence: it was easy to see that no doubt now remained in the young girl’s mind as to the reality of the scene; her eyes started with terror, her hands trembled, and she rapidly drew the bedclothes closer to her.
Perplexity: 7236862464.0000

Sentence: still, the presence of monte cristo at such an hour, his mysterious, fanciful, and extraordinary entrance into her room through the wall, might well seem impossibilities to her shattered reason.
Perplexity: 366972160.0000

Sentence: “do not call anyone—do not be alarmed,” said the count; “do not let a shade of suspicion or uneasiness remain in your breast; the man standing before you, valentine (for this time it is no ghost), is nothing more than the tenderest father and the most respectful friend you could dream of.” valentine could not reply; the voice which indicated the real presence of a being in the room, alarmed her so much that she feared to utter a syllable; still the expression of her eyes seemed to inquire, “if your intentions are pure, why are you here?” the count’s marvellous sagacity understood all that was passing in the young girl’s mind.
Perplexity: 139235664.0000

Sentence: “listen to me,” he said, “or, rather, look upon me; look at my face, paler even than usual, and my eyes, red with weariness—for four days i have not closed them, for i have been constantly watching you, to protect and preserve you for maximilian.” the blood mounted rapidly to the cheeks of valentine, for the name just announced by the count dispelled all the fear with which his presence had inspired her.
Perplexity: 249605440.0000

Sentence: “maximilian!” she exclaimed, and so sweet did the sound appear to her, that she repeated it—“maximilian!—has he then owned all to you?” “everything.
Perplexity: 449600544.0000

Sentence: he told me your life was his, and i have promised him that you shall live.” “you have promised him that i shall live?” “yes.” “but, sir, you spoke of vigilance and protection.
Perplexity: 12074609664.0000

Sentence: are you a doctor?” “yes; the best you could have at the present time, believe me.” “but you say you have watched?” said valentine uneasily; “where have you been?—i have not seen you.” the count extended his hand towards the library.
Perplexity: 142473136.0000

Sentence: “i was hidden behind that door,” he said, “which leads into the next house, which i have rented.” valentine turned her eyes away, and, with an indignant expression of pride and modest fear, exclaimed: “sir, i think you have been guilty of an unparalleled intrusion, and that what you call protection is more like an insult.” “valentine,” he answered, “during my long watch over you, all i have observed has been what people visited you, what nourishment was prepared, and what beverage was served; then, when the latter appeared dangerous to me, i entered, as i have now done, and substituted, in the place of the poison, a healthful draught; which, instead of producing the death intended, caused life to circulate in your veins.” “poison—death!” exclaimed valentine, half believing herself under the influence of some feverish hallucination; “what are you saying, sir?” 50071m “hush, my child,” said monte cristo, again placing his finger upon her lips, “i did say poison and death.
Perplexity: 432872544.0000

Sentence: but drink some of this;” and the count took a bottle from his pocket, containing a red liquid, of which he poured a few drops into the glass.
Perplexity: 453579040.0000

Sentence: “drink this, and then take nothing more tonight.” valentine stretched out her hand, but scarcely had she touched the glass when she drew back in fear.
Perplexity: 5023050240.0000

Sentence: monte cristo took the glass, drank half its contents, and then presented it to valentine, who smiled and swallowed the rest.
Perplexity: 643916160.0000

Perplexity: 191274768.0000

Perplexity: 345417024.0000

Sentence: “but, oh, how i passed that time!
Perplexity: 3608201984.0000

Sentence: oh, the wretched hours i have endured—the torture to which i have submitted when i saw the deadly poison poured into your glass, and how i trembled lest you should drink it before i could find time to throw it away!” “sir,” said valentine, at the height of her terror, “you say you endured tortures when you saw the deadly poison poured into my glass; but if you saw this, you must also have seen the person who poured it?” “yes.” valentine raised herself in bed, and drew over her chest, which appeared whiter than snow, the embroidered cambric, still moist with the cold dews of delirium, to which were now added those of terror.
Perplexity: 100385096.0000

Sentence: “you saw the person?” repeated the young girl.
Perplexity: 227562880.0000

Sentence: “yes,” repeated the count.
Perplexity: 558894848.0000

Sentence: “what you tell me is horrible, sir.
Perplexity: 331027488.0000

Sentence: you wish to make me believe something too dreadful.
Perplexity: 2461509376.0000

Sentence: what?—attempt to murder me in my father’s house, in my room, on my bed of sickness?
Perplexity: 446988352.0000

Sentence: oh, leave me, sir; you are tempting me—you make me doubt the goodness of providence—it is impossible, it cannot be!” “are you the first that this hand has stricken?
Perplexity: 4796905472.0000

Sentence: have you not seen m. de saint-méran, madame de saint-méran, barrois, all fall?
Perplexity: 1021004608.0000

Sentence: would not m. noirtier also have fallen a victim, had not the treatment he has been pursuing for the last three years neutralized the effects of the poison?” “oh, heaven,” said valentine; “is this the reason why grandpapa has made me share all his beverages during the last month?” “and have they all tasted of a slightly bitter flavor, like that of dried orange-peel?” “oh, yes, yes!” “then that explains all,” said monte cristo.
Perplexity: 2472869376.0000

Sentence: “your grandfather knows, then, that a poisoner lives here; perhaps he even suspects the person.
Perplexity: 2187976192.0000

Perplexity: 160748464.0000

Perplexity: 505471552.0000

Sentence: have you never seen anyone enter your room at night?” “oh, yes; i have frequently seen shadows pass close to me, approach, and disappear; but i took them for visions raised by my feverish imagination, and indeed when you entered i thought i was under the influence of delirium.” “then you do not know who it is that attempts your life?” 50073m “no,” said valentine; “who could desire my death?” “you shall know it now, then,” said monte cristo, listening.
Perplexity: 506194176.0000

Sentence: “how do you mean?” said valentine, looking anxiously around.
Perplexity: 41612732.0000

Sentence: “because you are not feverish or delirious tonight, but thoroughly awake; midnight is striking, which is the hour murderers choose.” “oh, heavens,” exclaimed valentine, wiping off the drops which ran down her forehead.
Perplexity: 1249453824.0000

Sentence: midnight struck slowly and sadly; every hour seemed to strike with leaden weight upon the heart of the poor girl.
Perplexity: 202658192.0000

Sentence: “valentine,” said the count, “summon up all your courage; still the beatings of your heart; do not let a sound escape you, and feign to be asleep; then you will see.” valentine seized the count’s hand.
Perplexity: 76620048.0000

Sentence: “i think i hear a noise,” she said; “leave me.” “good-bye, for the present,” replied the count, walking upon tiptoe towards the library door, and smiling with an expression so sad and paternal that the young girl’s heart was filled with gratitude.
Perplexity: 248635648.0000

Sentence: before closing the door he turned around once more, and said, “not a movement—not a word; let them think you asleep, or perhaps you may be killed before i have the power of helping you.” and with this fearful injunction the count disappeared through the door, which noiselessly closed after him.
Perplexity: 270845984.0000

Perplexity: 610180416.0000

Sentence: then valentine’s attention was engrossed by the clock in her room, which marked the seconds.
Perplexity: 416983200.0000

Sentence: she began counting them, remarking that they were much slower than the beatings of her heart; and still she doubted,—the inoffensive valentine could not imagine that anyone should desire her death.

Sentence: one terrible idea pressed upon her mind,—that someone existed in the world who had attempted to assassinate her, and who was about to endeavor to do so again.
Perplexity: 109427496.0000

Sentence: supposing this person, wearied at the inefficacy of the poison, should, as monte cristo intimated, have recourse to steel!—what if the count should have no time to run to her rescue!—what if her last moments were approaching, and she should never again see morrel!
Perplexity: 1220226432.0000

Sentence: when this terrible chain of ideas presented itself, valentine was nearly persuaded to ring the bell, and call for help.
Perplexity: 1300927616.0000

Sentence: but through the door she fancied she saw the luminous eye of the count—that eye which lived in her memory, and the recollection overwhelmed her with so much shame that she asked herself whether any amount of gratitude could ever repay his adventurous and devoted friendship.
Perplexity: 180378624.0000

Sentence: twenty minutes, twenty tedious minutes, passed thus, then ten more, and at last the clock struck the half-hour.
Perplexity: 46459912.0000

Sentence: just then the sound of finger-nails slightly grating against the door of the library informed valentine that the count was still watching, and recommended her to do the same; at the same time, on the opposite side, that is towards edward’s room, valentine fancied that she heard the creaking of the floor; she listened attentively, holding her breath till she was nearly suffocated; the lock turned, and the door slowly opened.
Perplexity: 310617664.0000

Sentence: valentine had raised herself upon her elbow, and had scarcely time to throw herself down on the bed and shade her eyes with her arm; then, trembling, agitated, and her heart beating with indescribable terror, she awaited the event.

Perplexity: 1241735040.0000

Sentence: during this short time valentine must have held her breath, or moved in some slight degree, for the woman, disturbed, stopped and leaned over the bed, in order the better to ascertain whether valentine slept: it was madame de villefort.
Perplexity: 880540480.0000

Sentence: on recognizing her step-mother, valentine could not repress a shudder, which caused a vibration in the bed.
Perplexity: 184229088.0000

Perplexity: 4371832832.0000

Sentence: the latter recollected the terrible caution of monte cristo; she fancied that the hand not holding the phial clasped a long sharp knife.
Perplexity: 36624896.0000

Sentence: then collecting all her remaining strength, she forced herself to close her eyes; but this simple operation upon the most delicate organs of our frame, generally so easy to accomplish, became almost impossible at this moment, so much did curiosity struggle to retain the eyelid open and learn the truth.
Perplexity: 3110933248.0000

Sentence: madame de villefort, however, reassured by the silence, which was alone disturbed by the regular breathing of valentine, again extended her hand, and half hidden by the curtains succeeded in emptying the contents of the phial into the glass.
Perplexity: 62204280.0000

Perplexity: 214502960.0000

Perplexity: 1781766144.0000

Sentence: “oh, yes;” she said, “i saw, but i cannot believe!” “would you rather die, then, and cause maximilian’s death?” “oh,” repeated the young girl, almost bewildered, “can i not leave the house?—can i not escape?” “valentine, the hand which now threatens you will pursue you everywhere; your servants will be seduced with gold, and death will be offered to you disguised in every shape.
Perplexity: 946474752.0000

Sentence: you will find it in the water you drink from the spring, in the fruit you pluck from the tree.” “but did you not say that my kind grandfather’s precaution had neutralized the poison?” “yes, but not against a strong dose; the poison will be changed, and the quantity increased.” he took the glass and raised it to his lips.
Perplexity: 753682112.0000

Perplexity: 2187976192.0000

Perplexity: 1050122816.0000

Sentence: the fortune is not her gift, but is inherited from my relations.” “certainly; and that is why m. and madame de saint-méran have died; that is why m. noirtier was sentenced the day he made you his heir; that is why you, in your turn, are to die—it is because your father would inherit your property, and your brother, his only son, succeed to his.” “edward?
Perplexity: 84004896.0000

Sentence: poor child!
Perplexity: 28483376.0000

Sentence: are all these crimes committed on his account?” “ah, then you at length understand?” “heaven grant that this may not be visited upon him!” “valentine, you are an angel!” “but why is my grandfather allowed to live?” “it was considered, that you dead, the fortune would naturally revert to your brother, unless he were disinherited; and besides, the crime appearing useless, it would be folly to commit it.” “and is it possible that this frightful combination of crimes has been invented by a woman?” “do you recollect in the arbor of the hôtel des postes, at perugia, seeing a man in a brown cloak, whom your stepmother was questioning upon _aqua tofana_?
Perplexity: 1218163712.0000

Sentence: well, ever since then, the infernal project has been ripening in her brain.” “ah, then, indeed, sir,” said the sweet girl, bathed in tears, “i see that i am condemned to die!” “no, valentine, for i have foreseen all their plots; no, your enemy is conquered since we know her, and you will live, valentine—live to be happy yourself, and to confer happiness upon a noble heart; but to insure this you must rely on me.” “command me, sir—what am i to do?” “you must blindly take what i give you.” “alas, were it only for my own sake, i should prefer to die!” “you must not confide in anyone—not even in your father.” “my father is not engaged in this fearful plot, is he, sir?” asked valentine, clasping her hands.
Perplexity: 227627984.0000

Sentence: “no; and yet your father, a man accustomed to judicial accusations, ought to have known that all these deaths have not happened naturally; it is he who should have watched over you—he should have occupied my place—he should have emptied that glass—he should have risen against the assassin.
Perplexity: 499467328.0000

Perplexity: 101892448.0000

Perplexity: 424883200.0000

Sentence: now, m. le procureur du roi,” said morrel with increasing vehemence, “no mercy is allowed; i denounce the crime; it is your place to seek the assassin.” the young man’s implacable eyes interrogated villefort, who, on his side, glanced from noirtier to d’avrigny.
Perplexity: 834749824.0000

Perplexity: 281499904.0000

Perplexity: 98098032.0000

Perplexity: 565220864.0000

Sentence: morrel, you are going to destroy yourself!” “indeed, count,” said morrel, shuddering; “what has put this into your head?” “i tell you that you are about to destroy yourself,” continued the count, “and here is proof of what i say;” and, approaching the desk, he removed the sheet of paper which morrel had placed over the letter he had begun, and took the latter in his hands.

Perplexity: 271623008.0000

Sentence: tell me, sir, could you have the courage to do so?” “yes, morrel,” said monte cristo, with a calmness which contrasted strangely with the young man’s excitement; “yes, i would do so.” “you?” exclaimed morrel, with increasing anger and reproach—“you, who have deceived me with false hopes, who have cheered and soothed me with vain promises, when i might, if not have saved her, at least have seen her die in my arms!
Perplexity: 332178624.0000

Sentence: you, who pretend to understand everything, even the hidden sources of knowledge,—and who enact the part of a guardian angel upon earth, and could not even find an antidote to a poison administered to a young girl!

Perplexity: 643177280.0000

Perplexity: 431836768.0000

Sentence: “why do you mention my father?” stammered he; “why do you mingle a recollection of him with the affairs of today?” “because i am he who saved your father’s life when he wished to destroy himself, as you do today—because i am the man who sent the purse to your young sister, and the _pharaon_ to old morrel—because i am the edmond dantès who nursed you, a child, on my knees.” morrel made another step back, staggering, breathless, crushed; then all his strength give way, and he fell prostrate at the feet of monte cristo.
Perplexity: 206195008.0000

Sentence: then his admirable nature underwent a complete and sudden revulsion; he arose, rushed out of the room and to the stairs, exclaiming energetically, “julie, julie—emmanuel, emmanuel!” monte cristo endeavored also to leave, but maximilian would have died rather than relax his hold of the handle of the door, which he closed upon the count.

Perplexity: 807220672.0000

Sentence: oh, it was cruel to us, and—dare i say it?—to you also.” “listen, my friends,” said the count—“i may call you so since we have really been friends for the last eleven years—the discovery of this secret has been occasioned by a great event which you must never know.
Perplexity: 669417472.0000

Sentence: i wished to bury it during my whole life in my own bosom, but your brother maximilian wrested it from me by a violence he repents of now, i am sure.” then turning around, and seeing that morrel, still on his knees, had thrown himself into an armchair, he added in a low voice, pressing emmanuel’s hand significantly, “watch over him.” “why so?” asked the young man, surprised.
Perplexity: 918230080.0000

Perplexity: 166687136.0000

Sentence: “oh,” said julie, pressing the purse to her heart, “no, no, i beseech you do not take it, for some unhappy day you will leave us, will you not?” “you have guessed rightly, madame,” replied monte cristo, smiling; “in a week i shall have left this country, where so many persons who merit the vengeance of heaven lived happily, while my father perished of hunger and grief.” while announcing his departure, the count fixed his eyes on morrel, and remarked that the words, “i shall have left this country,” had failed to rouse him from his lethargy.
Perplexity: 641927168.0000

Sentence: he then saw that he must make another struggle against the grief of his friend, and taking the hands of emmanuel and julie, which he pressed within his own, he said with the mild authority of a father: “my kind friends, leave me alone with maximilian.” julie saw the means offered of carrying off her precious relic, which monte cristo had forgotten.

Perplexity: 122178848.0000

Sentence: if anyone had said to your father, at the moment he raised the pistol to his head—if anyone had told me, when in my prison i pushed back the food i had not tasted for three days—if anyone had said to either of us then, ‘live—the day will come when you will be happy, and will bless life!’—no matter whose voice had spoken, we should have heard him with the smile of doubt, or the anguish of incredulity,—and yet how many times has your father blessed life while embracing you—how often have i myself——” “ah,” exclaimed morrel, interrupting the count, “you had only lost your liberty, my father had only lost his fortune, but i have lost valentine.” “look at me,” said monte cristo, with that expression which sometimes made him so eloquent and persuasive—“look at me.

Perplexity: 1249563648.0000

Sentence: “‘your very devoted husband, “‘baron danglars.’” the baroness had watched debray while he read this long and painful letter, and saw him, notwithstanding his self-control, change color once or twice.
Perplexity: 788082368.0000

Sentence: when he had ended the perusal, he folded the letter and resumed his pensive attitude.
Perplexity: 123846088.0000

Sentence: “well?” asked madame danglars, with an anxiety easy to be understood.
Perplexity: 181071472.0000

Sentence: “well, madame?” unhesitatingly repeated debray.
Perplexity: 132438088.0000

Sentence: “with what ideas does that letter inspire you?” “oh, it is simple enough, madame; it inspires me with the idea that m. danglars has left suspiciously.” “certainly; but is this all you have to say to me?” “i do not understand you,” said debray with freezing coldness.
Perplexity: 1029359936.0000

Sentence: “he is gone!
Perplexity: 185778176.0000

Sentence: gone, never to return!” “oh, madame, do not think that!” “i tell you he will never return.
Perplexity: 22968717312.0000

Sentence: i know his character; he is inflexible in any resolutions formed for his own interests.
Perplexity: 3298214144.0000

Sentence: if he could have made any use of me, he would have taken me with him; he leaves me in paris, as our separation will conduce to his benefit;—therefore he has gone, and i am free forever,” added madame danglars, in the same supplicating tone.
Perplexity: 667291136.0000

Sentence: debray, instead of answering, allowed her to remain in an attitude of nervous inquiry.
Perplexity: 3515286272.0000

Sentence: “well?” she said at length, “do you not answer me?” “i have but one question to ask you,—what do you intend to do?” “i was going to ask you,” replied the baroness with a beating heart.
Perplexity: 883260480.0000

Sentence: “ah, then, you wish to ask advice of me?” “yes; i do wish to ask your advice,” said madame danglars with anxious expectation.
Perplexity: 229421152.0000

Sentence: “then if you wish to take my advice,” said the young man coldly, “i would recommend you to travel.” “to travel!” she murmured.
Perplexity: 18347016.0000

Sentence: “certainly; as m. danglars says, you are rich, and perfectly free.
Perplexity: 1590564864.0000

Sentence: in my opinion, a withdrawal from paris is absolutely necessary after the double catastrophe of mademoiselle danglars’ broken contract and m. danglars’ disappearance.
Perplexity: 203010240.0000

Sentence: the world will think you abandoned and poor, for the wife of a bankrupt would never be forgiven, were she to keep up an appearance of opulence.
Perplexity: 143079056.0000

Sentence: you have only to remain in paris for about a fortnight, telling the world you are abandoned, and relating the details of this desertion to your best friends, who will soon spread the report.
Perplexity: 49650456.0000

Sentence: then you can quit your house, leaving your jewels and giving up your jointure, and everyone’s mouth will be filled with praises of your disinterestedness.
Perplexity: 375062528.0000

Sentence: they will know you are deserted, and think you also poor, for i alone know your real financial position, and am quite ready to give up my accounts as an honest partner.” the dread with which the pale and motionless baroness listened to this, was equalled by the calm indifference with which debray had spoken.
Perplexity: 191799024.0000

Sentence: “deserted?” she repeated; “ah, yes, i am, indeed, deserted!
Perplexity: 36050616.0000

Sentence: you are right, sir, and no one can doubt my position.” these were the only words that this proud and violently enamoured woman could utter in response to debray.
Perplexity: 431613632.0000

Sentence: 50137m “but then you are rich,—very rich, indeed,” continued debray, taking out some papers from his pocket-book, which he spread upon the table.
Perplexity: 1514959872.0000

Sentence: madame danglars did not see them; she was engaged in stilling the beatings of her heart, and restraining the tears which were ready to gush forth.
Perplexity: 39764368.0000

Sentence: at length a sense of dignity prevailed, and if she did not entirely master her agitation, she at least succeeded in preventing the fall of a single tear.
Perplexity: 80478816.0000

Sentence: “madame,” said debray, “it is nearly six months since we have been associated.
Perplexity: 117012712.0000

Sentence: you furnished a principal of 100,000 francs.
Perplexity: 253661424.0000

Sentence: our partnership began in the month of april.
Perplexity: 213924000.0000

Perplexity: 2267527680.0000

Sentence: in june the profit amounted to 900,000.
Perplexity: 310342304.0000

Sentence: in july we added 1,700,000 francs,—it was, you know, the month of the spanish bonds.
Perplexity: 382047328.0000

Sentence: in august we lost 300,000 francs at the beginning of the month, but on the 13th we made up for it, and we now find that our accounts, reckoning from the first day of partnership up to yesterday, when i closed them, showed a capital of 2,400,000 francs, that is, 1,200,000 for each of us.
Perplexity: 3664233216.0000

Sentence: now, madame,” said debray, delivering up his accounts in the methodical manner of a stockbroker, “there are still 80,000 francs, the interest of this money, in my hands.” “but,” said the baroness, “i thought you never put the money out to interest.” “excuse me, madame,” said debray coldly, “i had your permission to do so, and i have made use of it.
Perplexity: 43077368.0000

Sentence: there are, then, 40,000 francs for your share, besides the 100,000 you furnished me to begin with, making in all 1,340,000 francs for your portion.
Perplexity: 319598112.0000

Sentence: now, madame, i took the precaution of drawing out your money the day before yesterday; it is not long ago, you see, and i was in continual expectation of being called on to deliver up my accounts.
Perplexity: 429056864.0000

Sentence: there is your money,—half in bank-notes, the other half in checks payable to bearer.
Perplexity: 156578224.0000

Sentence: i say _there_, for as i did not consider my house safe enough, or lawyers sufficiently discreet, and as landed property carries evidence with it, and moreover since you have no right to possess anything independent of your husband, i have kept this sum, now your whole fortune, in a chest concealed under that closet, and for greater security i myself concealed it there.
Perplexity: 121361768.0000

Sentence: “now, madame,” continued debray, first opening the closet, then the chest;—“now, madame, here are 800 notes of 1,000 francs each, resembling, as you see, a large book bound in iron; to this i add a certificate in the funds of 25,000 francs; then, for the odd cash, making i think about 110,000 francs, here is a check upon my banker, who, not being m. danglars, will pay you the amount, you may rest assured.” madame danglars mechanically took the check, the bond, and the heap of bank-notes.
Perplexity: 172320496.0000

Sentence: this enormous fortune made no great appearance on the table.
Perplexity: 960087680.0000

Sentence: madame danglars, with tearless eyes, but with her breast heaving with concealed emotion, placed the bank-notes in her bag, put the certificate and check into her pocket-book, and then, standing pale and mute, awaited one kind word of consolation.
Perplexity: 510109792.0000

Sentence: but she waited in vain.
Perplexity: 187629568.0000

Sentence: “now, madame,” said debray, “you have a splendid fortune, an income of about 60,000 livres a year, which is enormous for a woman who cannot keep an establishment here for a year, at least.
Perplexity: 234628912.0000

Sentence: you will be able to indulge all your fancies; besides, should you find your income insufficient, you can, for the sake of the past, madame, make use of mine; and i am ready to offer you all i possess, on loan.” “thank you, sir—thank you,” replied the baroness; “you forget that what you have just paid me is much more than a poor woman requires, who intends for some time, at least, to retire from the world.” debray was, for a moment, surprised, but immediately recovering himself, he bowed with an air which seemed to say, “as you please, madame.” madame danglars had until then, perhaps, hoped for something; but when she saw the careless bow of debray, and the glance by which it was accompanied, together with his significant silence, she raised her head, and without passion or violence or even hesitation, ran downstairs, disdaining to address a last farewell to one who could thus part from her.
Perplexity: 158548768.0000

Sentence: “bah,” said debray, when she had left, “these are fine projects!
Perplexity: 564558208.0000

Sentence: she will remain at home, read novels, and speculate at cards, since she can no longer do so on the bourse.” then taking up his account book, he cancelled with the greatest care all the entries of the amounts he had just paid away.
Perplexity: 275571200.0000

Sentence: “i have 1,060,000 francs remaining,” he said.
Perplexity: 235233376.0000

Sentence: “what a pity mademoiselle de villefort is dead!
Perplexity: 1466616704.0000

Sentence: she suited me in every respect, and i would have married her.” and he calmly waited until the twenty minutes had elapsed after madame danglars’ departure before he left the house.
Perplexity: 294133984.0000

Sentence: during this time he occupied himself in making figures, with his watch by his side.
Perplexity: 114638784.0000

Sentence: asmodeus—that diabolical personage, who would have been created by every fertile imagination if le sage had not acquired the priority in his great masterpiece—would have enjoyed a singular spectacle, if he had lifted up the roof of the little house in the rue saint-germain-des-prés, while debray was casting up his figures.
Perplexity: 448917600.0000

Sentence: above the room in which debray had been dividing two millions and a half with madame danglars was another, inhabited by persons who have played too prominent a part in the incidents we have related for their appearance not to create some interest.
Perplexity: 154065152.0000

Sentence: mercédès and albert were in that room.
Perplexity: 217420512.0000

Sentence: mercédès was much changed within the last few days; not that even in her days of fortune she had ever dressed with the magnificent display which makes us no longer able to recognize a woman when she appears in a plain and simple attire; nor indeed, had she fallen into that state of depression where it is impossible to conceal the garb of misery; no, the change in mercédès was that her eye no longer sparkled, her lips no longer smiled, and there was now a hesitation in uttering the words which formerly sprang so fluently from her ready wit.
Perplexity: 212720448.0000

Sentence: it was not poverty which had broken her spirit; it was not a want of courage which rendered her poverty burdensome.
Perplexity: 109380536.0000

Sentence: mercédès, although deposed from the exalted position she had occupied, lost in the sphere she had now chosen, like a person passing from a room splendidly lighted into utter darkness, appeared like a queen, fallen from her palace to a hovel, and who, reduced to strict necessity, could neither become reconciled to the earthen vessels she was herself forced to place upon the table, nor to the humble pallet which had become her bed.
Perplexity: 2479835904.0000

Sentence: the beautiful catalane and noble countess had lost both her proud glance and charming smile, because she saw nothing but misery around her; the walls were hung with one of the gray papers which economical landlords choose as not likely to show the dirt; the floor was uncarpeted; the furniture attracted the attention to the poor attempt at luxury; indeed, everything offended eyes accustomed to refinement and elegance.
Perplexity: 54499476.0000

Sentence: madame de morcerf had lived there since leaving her house; the continual silence of the spot oppressed her; still, seeing that albert continually watched her countenance to judge the state of her feelings, she constrained herself to assume a monotonous smile of the lips alone, which, contrasted with the sweet and beaming expression that usually shone from her eyes, seemed like “moonlight on a statue,”—yielding light without warmth.
Perplexity: 553529984.0000

Sentence: albert, too, was ill at ease; the remains of luxury prevented him from sinking into his actual position.
Perplexity: 407803424.0000

Sentence: if he wished to go out without gloves, his hands appeared too white; if he wished to walk through the town, his boots seemed too highly polished.
Perplexity: 235718896.0000

Sentence: yet these two noble and intelligent creatures, united by the indissoluble ties of maternal and filial love, had succeeded in tacitly understanding one another, and economizing their stores, and albert had been able to tell his mother without extorting a change of countenance: “mother, we have no more money.” 50141m mercédès had never known misery; she had often, in her youth, spoken of poverty, but between want and necessity, those synonymous words, there is a wide difference.
Perplexity: 109882400.0000

Sentence: amongst the catalans, mercédès wished for a thousand things, but still she never really wanted any.
Perplexity: 939528512.0000

Sentence: so long as the nets were good, they caught fish; and so long as they sold their fish, they were able to buy twine for new nets.
Perplexity: 550586880.0000

Sentence: and then, shut out from friendship, having but one affection, which could not be mixed up with her ordinary pursuits, she thought of herself—of no one but herself.
Perplexity: 170886560.0000

Sentence: upon the little she earned she lived as well as she could; now there were two to be supported, and nothing to live upon.
Perplexity: 322492032.0000

Sentence: winter approached.
Perplexity: 127393368.0000

Sentence: mercédès had no fire in that cold and naked room—she, who was accustomed to stoves which heated the house from the hall to the boudoir; she had not even one little flower—she whose apartment had been a conservatory of costly exotics.
Perplexity: 65475256.0000

Sentence: but she had her son.
Perplexity: 62180196.0000

Sentence: hitherto the excitement of fulfilling a duty had sustained them.
Perplexity: 719930176.0000

Sentence: excitement, like enthusiasm, sometimes renders us unconscious to the things of earth.
Perplexity: 193876736.0000

Sentence: but the excitement had calmed down, and they felt themselves obliged to descend from dreams to reality; after having exhausted the ideal, they found they must talk of the actual.
Perplexity: 1187190656.0000

Sentence: “mother,” exclaimed albert, just as madame danglars was descending the stairs, “let us reckon our riches, if you please; i want capital to build my plans upon.” “capital—nothing!” replied mercédès with a mournful smile.
Perplexity: 109270024.0000

Sentence: “no, mother,—capital 3,000 francs.
Perplexity: 393618816.0000

Sentence: and i have an idea of our leading a delightful life upon this 3,000 francs.” “child!” sighed mercédès.
Perplexity: 78547224.0000

Sentence: “alas, dear mother,” said the young man, “i have unhappily spent too much of your money not to know the value of it.
Perplexity: 1839416320.0000

Sentence: these 3,000 francs are enormous, and i intend building upon this foundation a miraculous certainty for the future.” “you say this, my dear boy; but do you think we ought to accept these 3,000 francs?” said mercédès, coloring.
Perplexity: 38786220.0000

Sentence: “i think so,” answered albert in a firm tone.
Perplexity: 374995264.0000

Sentence: “we will accept them the more readily, since we have them not here; you know they are buried in the garden of the little house in the allées de meilhan, at marseilles.
Perplexity: 64180936.0000

Sentence: with 200 francs we can reach marseilles.” “with 200 francs?—are you sure, albert?” “oh, as for that, i have made inquiries respecting the diligences and steamboats, and my calculations are made.
Perplexity: 102838408.0000

Sentence: you will take your place in the _coupé_ to châlons.
Perplexity: 475144608.0000

Sentence: you see, mother, i treat you handsomely for thirty-five francs.” albert then took a pen, and wrote: frs.

Sentence: _coupé_, thirty-five francs........ .............. ........ 35.
Perplexity: 1091465600.0000

Perplexity: 802290432.0000

Sentence: do you not see that i reserve eighty francs for myself?
Perplexity: 141077264.0000

Sentence: a young man does not require luxuries; besides, i know what travelling is.” “with a post-chaise and valet de chambre?” “any way, mother.” “well, be it so.
Perplexity: 83656480.0000

Sentence: but these 200 francs?” “here they are, and 200 more besides.
Perplexity: 2820439296.0000

Sentence: see, i have sold my watch for 100 francs, and the guard and seals for 300.
Perplexity: 170045760.0000

Perplexity: 166076560.0000

Sentence: still the same story of superfluities!
Perplexity: 23549992.0000

Sentence: now i think we are rich, since instead of the 114 francs we require for the journey we find ourselves in possession of 250.” “but we owe something in this house?” “thirty francs; but i pay that out of my 150 francs,—that is understood,—and as i require only eighty francs for my journey, you see i am overwhelmed with luxury.
Perplexity: 84333680.0000

Sentence: but that is not all.
Perplexity: 914470528.0000

Sentence: what do you say to this, mother?” and albert took out of a little pocket-book with golden clasps, a remnant of his old fancies, or perhaps a tender souvenir from one of the mysterious and veiled ladies who used to knock at his little door,—albert took out of this pocket-book a note of 1,000 francs.
Perplexity: 1645169792.0000

Sentence: “what is this?” asked mercédès.
Perplexity: 131490184.0000

Sentence: “a thousand francs.” “but whence have you obtained them?” “listen to me, mother, and do not yield too much to agitation.” and albert, rising, kissed his mother on both cheeks, then stood looking at her.
Perplexity: 316909632.0000

Sentence: “you cannot imagine, mother, how beautiful i think you!” said the young man, impressed with a profound feeling of filial love.
Perplexity: 405267872.0000

Sentence: “indeed, you only wanted misfortune to change my love for you to admiration.
Perplexity: 425871392.0000

Sentence: i am not unhappy while i possess my son!” “ah, just so,” said albert; “here begins the trial.
Perplexity: 3661222144.0000

Sentence: do you know the decision we have come to, mother?” “have we come to any?” “yes; it is decided that you are to live at marseilles, and that i am to leave for africa, where i will earn for myself the right to use the name i now bear, instead of the one i have thrown aside.” mercédès sighed.
Perplexity: 334470528.0000

Sentence: “well, mother, i yesterday engaged myself as substitute in the spahis,”25 added the young man, lowering his eyes with a certain feeling of shame, for even he was unconscious of the sublimity of his self-abasement.
Perplexity: 2616861952.0000

Sentence: “i thought my body was my own, and that i might sell it.
Perplexity: 366930176.0000

Sentence: i yesterday took the place of another.
Perplexity: 194521984.0000

Sentence: i sold myself for more than i thought i was worth,” he added, attempting to smile; “i fetched 2,000 francs.” “then these 1,000 francs——” said mercédès, shuddering.
Perplexity: 350457280.0000

Sentence: “are the half of the sum, mother; the other will be paid in a year.” mercédès raised her eyes to heaven with an expression it would be impossible to describe, and tears, which had hitherto been restrained, now yielded to her emotion, and ran down her cheeks.

Sentence: “the price of his blood!” she murmured.

Perplexity: 772085120.0000

Sentence: i declare, i expect to look magnificent in it, and chose that regiment only from vanity.” mercédès sighed while endeavoring to smile; the devoted mother felt that she ought not to allow the whole weight of the sacrifice to fall upon her son.
Perplexity: 58156420.0000

Sentence: “well, now you understand, mother!” continued albert; “here are more than 4,000 francs settled on you; upon these you can live at least two years.” “do you think so?” said mercédès.
Perplexity: 1412663552.0000

Sentence: these words were uttered in so mournful a tone that their real meaning did not escape albert; he felt his heart beat, and taking his mother’s hand within his own he said, tenderly: “yes, you will live!” “i shall live!—then you will not leave me, albert?” “mother, i must go,” said albert in a firm, calm voice; “you love me too well to wish me to remain useless and idle with you; besides, i have signed.” 50145m “you will obey your own wish and the will of heaven!” “not my own wish, mother, but reason—necessity.

Perplexity: 435817664.0000

Sentence: certainly a call to the visitors’ room had scarcely astonished andrea less than themselves, for the wily youth, instead of making use of his privilege of waiting to be claimed on his entry into la force, had maintained a rigid silence.

Sentence: 50153m “everything,” he said, “proves me to be under the protection of some powerful person,—this sudden fortune, the facility with which i have overcome all obstacles, an unexpected family and an illustrious name awarded to me, gold showered down upon me, and the most splendid alliances about to be entered into.

Sentence: andrea felt his heart leap with joy.
Perplexity: 250883168.0000

Perplexity: 20518192.0000

Perplexity: 1255325440.0000

Sentence: ah, yes; we burn, as they say at the game of pincette.
Perplexity: 1289880704.0000

Sentence: come, let us talk a little about my father.” “who, then, am i?” “you, sir?—you are my adopted father.
Perplexity: 520543008.0000

Sentence: but it was not you, i presume, who placed at my disposal 100,000 francs, which i spent in four or five months; it was not you who manufactured an italian gentleman for my father; it was not you who introduced me into the world, and had me invited to a certain dinner at auteuil, which i fancy i am eating at this moment, in company with the most distinguished people in paris—amongst the rest with a certain procureur, whose acquaintance i did very wrong not to cultivate, for he would have been very useful to me just now;—it was not you, in fact, who bailed me for one or two millions, when the fatal discovery of my little secret took place.

Perplexity: 1743412096.0000

Sentence: i will say——” “do you think you are engaged with a pygmy like yourself?” said bertuccio, in so calm a tone, and with so steadfast a look, that andrea was moved to the very soul.

Perplexity: 531654816.0000

Sentence: perhaps it was the christian exhortations of the abbé, perhaps his kind charity, perhaps his persuasive words, which had restored the courage of noirtier, for ever since he had conversed with the priest his violent despair had yielded to a calm resignation which surprised all who knew his excessive affection for valentine.
Perplexity: 248438448.0000

Sentence: m. de villefort had not seen his father since the morning of the death.

Perplexity: 182987616.0000

Sentence: the proofs were certainly not convincing, since they rested upon a few words written by an escaped galley-slave on his death-bed, and who might have been actuated by hatred or revenge in accusing his companion.
Perplexity: 302012224.0000

Sentence: but the mind of the procureur was made up; he felt assured that benedetto was guilty, and he hoped by his skill in conducting this aggravated case to flatter his self-love, which was about the only vulnerable point left in his frozen heart.
Perplexity: 260157216.0000

Sentence: the case was therefore prepared owing to the incessant labor of villefort, who wished it to be the first on the list in the coming assizes.
Perplexity: 41872600.0000

Perplexity: 6283299328.0000

Perplexity: 2012600064.0000

Sentence: he remembered that morcerf had been taxed at 4,000 crowns, and as he considered himself of much greater importance than morcerf he fixed his own price at 8,000 crowns.
Perplexity: 502393824.0000

Sentence: eight thousand crowns amounted to 48,000 livres; he would then have about 5,050,000 francs left.

Sentence: with this sum he could manage to keep out of difficulties.
Perplexity: 2309729536.0000

Sentence: therefore, tolerably secure in being able to extricate himself from his position, provided he were not rated at the unreasonable sum of 5,050,000 francs, he stretched himself on his bed, and after turning over two or three times, fell asleep with the tranquillity of the hero whose life luigi vampa was studying.

Perplexity: 108414720.0000

Sentence: he borrowed this from _don quixote_, the only book he had ever read, but which he still slightly remembered.
Perplexity: 121479416.0000

Sentence: “no,” he cried, “they have not wounded, but perhaps they have robbed me!” and he thrust his hands into his pockets.
Perplexity: 99391912.0000

Perplexity: 275862592.0000

Sentence: “singular bandits!” he exclaimed; “they have left me my purse and pocket-book.

Perplexity: 163858624.0000

Perplexity: 510207104.0000

Perplexity: 736286208.0000

Sentence: without this, danglars would have been quite ignorant of the time, for daylight did not reach his cell.
Perplexity: 856501824.0000

Sentence: should he demand an explanation from the bandits, or should he wait patiently for them to propose it?
Perplexity: 260480944.0000

Sentence: the last alternative seemed the most prudent, so he waited until twelve o’clock.
Perplexity: 259599600.0000

Sentence: during all this time a sentinel, who had been relieved at eight o’clock, had been watching his door.
Perplexity: 81975848.0000

Sentence: 50249m danglars suddenly felt a strong inclination to see the person who kept watch over him.
Perplexity: 679296896.0000

Sentence: he had noticed that a few rays, not of daylight, but from a lamp, penetrated through the ill-joined planks of the door; he approached just as the brigand was refreshing himself with a mouthful of brandy, which, owing to the leathern bottle containing it, sent forth an odor which was extremely unpleasant to danglars.
Perplexity: 276672480.0000

Sentence: “faugh!” he exclaimed, retreating to the farther corner of his cell.
Perplexity: 1223594112.0000

Perplexity: 1052613376.0000

Sentence: he was an athletic, gigantic bandit, with large eyes, thick lips, and a flat nose; his red hair fell in dishevelled masses like snakes around his shoulders.
Perplexity: 1201941120.0000

Sentence: “ah, ha,” cried danglars, “this fellow is more like an ogre than anything else; however, i am rather too old and tough to be very good eating!” we see that danglars was collected enough to jest; at the same time, as though to disprove the ogreish propensities, the man took some black bread, cheese, and onions from his wallet, which he began devouring voraciously.
Perplexity: 3488521984.0000

Sentence: “may i be hanged,” said danglars, glancing at the bandit’s dinner through the crevices of the door,—“may i be hanged if i can understand how people can eat such filth!” and he withdrew to seat himself upon his goat-skin, which reminded him of the smell of the brandy.
Perplexity: 2235167744.0000

Sentence: but the mysteries of nature are incomprehensible, and there are certain invitations contained in even the coarsest food which appeal very irresistibly to a fasting stomach.
Perplexity: 239482560.0000

Sentence: danglars felt his own not to be very well supplied just then, and gradually the man appeared less ugly, the bread less black, and the cheese more fresh, while those dreadful vulgar onions recalled to his mind certain sauces and side-dishes, which his cook prepared in a very superior manner whenever he said, “monsieur deniseau, let me have a nice little fricassee today.” he got up and knocked on the door; the bandit raised his head.
Perplexity: 427367808.0000

Sentence: danglars knew that he was heard, so he redoubled his blows.
Perplexity: 138049648.0000

Sentence: “_che cosa?_” asked the bandit.
Perplexity: 2390231552.0000

Sentence: “come, come,” said danglars, tapping his fingers against the door, “i think it is quite time to think of giving me something to eat!” but whether he did not understand him, or whether he had received no orders respecting the nourishment of danglars, the giant, without answering, went on with his dinner.
Perplexity: 918897600.0000

Sentence: danglars’ feelings were hurt, and not wishing to put himself under obligations to the brute, the banker threw himself down again on his goat-skin and did not breathe another word.

Sentence: four hours passed by and the giant was replaced by another bandit.
Perplexity: 205693792.0000

Perplexity: 1084766208.0000

Sentence: it was, indeed, peppino who was preparing to mount guard as comfortably as possible by seating himself opposite to the door, and placing between his legs an earthen pan, containing chick-peas stewed with bacon.

Sentence: near the pan he also placed a pretty little basket of villetri grapes and a flask of orvieto.

Perplexity: 316933216.0000

Sentence: “come,” he said to himself, “let me try if he will be more tractable than the other;” and he tapped gently at the door.
Perplexity: 662347072.0000

Sentence: “_on y va_,” (coming) exclaimed peppino, who from frequenting the house of signor pastrini understood french perfectly in all its idioms.
Perplexity: 37232960.0000

Sentence: danglars immediately recognized him as the man who had called out in such a furious manner, “put in your head!” but this was not the time for recrimination, so he assumed his most agreeable manner and said with a gracious smile: “excuse me, sir, but are they not going to give me any dinner?” “does your excellency happen to be hungry?” “happen to be hungry,—that’s pretty good, when i haven’t eaten for twenty-four hours!” muttered danglars.
Perplexity: 3890332160.0000

Sentence: then he added aloud, “yes, sir, i am hungry—very hungry.” “and your excellency wants something to eat?” “at once, if possible” “nothing easier,” said peppino.
Perplexity: 770508096.0000

Sentence: “here you can get anything you want; by paying for it, of course, as among honest folk.” “of course!” cried danglars.
Perplexity: 241523376.0000

Sentence: “although, in justice, the people who arrest and imprison you, ought, at least, to feed you.” “that is not the custom, excellency,” said peppino.
Perplexity: 774688704.0000

Sentence: “a bad reason,” replied danglars, who reckoned on conciliating his keeper; “but i am content.
Perplexity: 380160992.0000

Sentence: let me have some dinner!” “at once!
Perplexity: 368868288.0000

Sentence: what would your excellency like?” and peppino placed his pan on the ground, so that the steam rose directly under the nostrils of danglars.
Perplexity: 196586464.0000

Sentence: “give your orders.” “have you kitchens here?” “kitchens?—of course—complete ones.” “and cooks?” “excellent!” “well, a fowl, fish, game,—it signifies little, so that i eat.” “as your excellency pleases.
Perplexity: 115005400.0000

Sentence: you mentioned a fowl, i think?” “yes, a fowl.” peppino, turning around, shouted, “a fowl for his excellency!” his voice yet echoed in the archway when a handsome, graceful, and half-naked young man appeared, bearing a fowl in a silver dish on his head, without the assistance of his hands.
Perplexity: 176420080.0000

Sentence: “i could almost believe myself at the café de paris,” murmured danglars.
Perplexity: 219319344.0000

Sentence: “here, your excellency,” said peppino, taking the fowl from the young bandit and placing it on the worm-eaten table, which with the stool and the goat-skin bed formed the entire furniture of the cell.

Perplexity: 174188880.0000

Sentence: they might not be satisfied, and——” “ah, ha,” thought danglars, “this is not so much like paris, except that i shall probably be skinned!
Perplexity: 398656160.0000

Sentence: never mind, i’ll fix that all right.
Perplexity: 269181472.0000

Sentence: i have always heard how cheap poultry is in italy; i should think a fowl is worth about twelve sous at rome.—there,” he said, throwing a louis down.
Perplexity: 960611584.0000

Sentence: peppino picked up the louis, and danglars again prepared to carve the fowl.
Perplexity: 36142804.0000

Sentence: “stay a moment, your excellency,” said peppino, rising; “you still owe me something.” “i said they would skin me,” thought danglars; but resolving to resist the extortion, he said, “come, how much do i owe you for this fowl?” “your excellency has given me a louis on account.” “a louis on account for a fowl?” “certainly; and your excellency now owes me 4,999 louis.” danglars opened his enormous eyes on hearing this gigantic joke.
Perplexity: 382476032.0000

Sentence: “very droll,” he muttered, “very droll indeed,” and he again began to carve the fowl, when peppino stopped the baron’s right hand with his left, and held out his other hand.

Perplexity: 297283488.0000

Sentence: stay, here is another louis for you.” “then that will make only 4,998 louis more,” said peppino with the same indifference.
Perplexity: 20116844.0000

Sentence: “i shall get them all in time.” “oh, as for that,” said danglars, angry at this prolongation of the jest,—“as for that you won’t get them at all.

Sentence: go to the devil!
Perplexity: 310126912.0000

Perplexity: 161601248.0000

Sentence: he again arose and went to the door.
Perplexity: 695904832.0000

Perplexity: 213766144.0000

Sentence: we must confess these three strange names struck us; and it immediately occurred to us that they were but pseudonyms, under which d’artagnan had disguised names perhaps illustrious, or else that the bearers of these borrowed names had themselves chosen them on the day in which, from caprice, discontent, or want of fortune, they had donned the simple musketeer’s uniform.
Perplexity: 418776544.0000

Perplexity: 46663284.0000

Sentence: too big for a youth, too small for a grown man, an experienced eye might have taken him for a farmer’s son upon a journey had it not been for the long sword which, dangling from a leather baldric, hit against the calves of its owner as he walked, and against the rough side of his steed when he was on horseback.

Sentence: it was a béarn pony, from twelve to fourteen years old, yellow in his hide, without a hair in his tail, but not without windgalls on his legs, which, though going with his head lower than his knees, rendering a martingale quite unnecessary, contrived nevertheless to perform his eight leagues a day.
Perplexity: 83518576.0000

Sentence: unfortunately, the qualities of this horse were so well concealed under his strange-colored hide and his unaccountable gait, that at a time when everybody was a connoisseur in horseflesh, the appearance of the aforesaid pony at meung—which place he had entered about a quarter of an hour before, by the gate of beaugency—produced an unfavorable feeling, which extended to his rider.
Perplexity: 46475600.0000

Sentence: and this feeling had been more painfully perceived by young d’artagnan—for so was the don quixote of this second rosinante named—from his not being able to conceal from himself the ridiculous appearance that such a steed gave him, good horseman as he was.

Perplexity: 508551520.0000

Sentence: don quixote took windmills for giants, and sheep for armies; d’artagnan took every smile for an insult, and every look as a provocation—whence it resulted that from tarbes to meung his fist was constantly doubled, or his hand on the hilt of his sword; and yet the fist did not descend upon any jaw, nor did the sword issue from its scabbard.
Perplexity: 533049984.0000

Sentence: it was not that the sight of the wretched pony did not excite numerous smiles on the countenances of passers-by; but as against the side of this pony rattled a sword of respectable length, and as over this sword gleamed an eye rather ferocious than haughty, these passers-by repressed their hilarity, or if hilarity prevailed over prudence, they endeavored to laugh only on one side, like the masks of the ancients.

Perplexity: 50260064.0000

Perplexity: 136251744.0000

Sentence: d’artagnan made all these remarks with the rapidity of a most minute observer, and doubtless from an instinctive feeling that this stranger was destined to have a great influence over his future life.
Perplexity: 306094336.0000

Sentence: now, as at the moment in which d’artagnan fixed his eyes upon the gentleman in the violet doublet, the gentleman made one of his most knowing and profound remarks respecting the béarnese pony, his two auditors laughed even louder than before, and he himself, though contrary to his custom, allowed a pale smile (if i may be allowed to use such an expression) to stray over his countenance.
Perplexity: 120943736.0000

Sentence: this time there could be no doubt; d’artagnan was really insulted.
Perplexity: 72726800.0000

Sentence: full, then, of this conviction, he pulled his cap down over his eyes, and endeavoring to copy some of the court airs he had picked up in gascony among young traveling nobles, he advanced with one hand on the hilt of his sword and the other resting on his hip.
Perplexity: 79572016.0000

Sentence: unfortunately, as he advanced, his anger increased at every step; and instead of the proper and lofty speech he had prepared as a prelude to his challenge, he found nothing at the tip of his tongue but a gross personality, which he accompanied with a furious gesture.
Perplexity: 970321664.0000

Sentence: “i say, sir, you sir, who are hiding yourself behind that shutter—yes, you, sir, tell me what you are laughing at, and we will laugh together!” the gentleman raised his eyes slowly from the nag to his cavalier, as if he required some time to ascertain whether it could be to him that such strange reproaches were addressed; then, when he could not possibly entertain any doubt of the matter, his eyebrows slightly bent, and with an accent of irony and insolence impossible to be described, he replied to d’artagnan, “i was not speaking to you, sir.” “but i am speaking to you!” replied the young man, additionally exasperated with this mixture of insolence and good manners, of politeness and scorn.
Perplexity: 79569136.0000

Sentence: the stranger looked at him again with a slight smile, and retiring from the window, came out of the hostelry with a slow step, and placed himself before the horse, within two paces of d’artagnan.
Perplexity: 969019584.0000

Sentence: his quiet manner and the ironical expression of his countenance redoubled the mirth of the persons with whom he had been talking, and who still remained at the window.
Perplexity: 323795616.0000

Sentence: d’artagnan, seeing him approach, drew his sword a foot out of the scabbard.
Perplexity: 209081680.0000

Sentence: “this horse is decidedly, or rather has been in his youth, a buttercup,” resumed the stranger, continuing the remarks he had begun, and addressing himself to his auditors at the window, without paying the least attention to the exasperation of d’artagnan, who, however, placed himself between him and them.
Perplexity: 89243320.0000

Sentence: “it is a color very well known in botany, but till the present time very rare among horses.” “there are people who laugh at the horse that would not dare to laugh at the master,” cried the young emulator of the furious tréville.
Perplexity: 722300032.0000

Sentence: “i do not often laugh, sir,” replied the stranger, “as you may perceive by the expression of my countenance; but nevertheless i retain the privilege of laughing when i please.” “and i,” cried d’artagnan, “will allow no man to laugh when it displeases me!” “indeed, sir,” continued the stranger, more calm than ever; “well, that is perfectly right!” and turning on his heel, was about to re-enter the hostelry by the front gate, beneath which d’artagnan on arriving had observed a saddled horse.
Perplexity: 1167786624.0000

Sentence: but, d’artagnan was not of a character to allow a man to escape him thus who had the insolence to ridicule him.
Perplexity: 513665632.0000

Sentence: he drew his sword entirely from the scabbard, and followed him, crying, “turn, turn, master joker, lest i strike you behind!” “strike me!” said the other, turning on his heels, and surveying the young man with as much astonishment as contempt.
Perplexity: 625877568.0000

Sentence: “why, my good fellow, you must be mad!” then, in a suppressed tone, as if speaking to himself, “this is annoying,” continued he.
Perplexity: 874965504.0000

Sentence: “what a godsend this would be for his majesty, who is seeking everywhere for brave fellows to recruit for his musketeers!” he had scarcely finished, when d’artagnan made such a furious lunge at him that if he had not sprung nimbly backward, it is probable he would have jested for the last time.
Perplexity: 1108797440.0000

Sentence: the stranger, then perceiving that the matter went beyond raillery, drew his sword, saluted his adversary, and seriously placed himself on guard.
Perplexity: 1673332480.0000

Sentence: but at the same moment, his two auditors, accompanied by the host, fell upon d’artagnan with sticks, shovels and tongs.
Perplexity: 626117632.0000

Sentence: this caused so rapid and complete a diversion from the attack that d’artagnan’s adversary, while the latter turned round to face this shower of blows, sheathed his sword with the same precision, and instead of an actor, which he had nearly been, became a spectator of the fight—a part in which he acquitted himself with his usual impassiveness, muttering, nevertheless, “a plague upon these gascons!
Perplexity: 110374968.0000

Sentence: replace him on his orange horse, and let him begone!” “not before i have killed you, poltroon!” cried d’artagnan, making the best face possible, and never retreating one step before his three assailants, who continued to shower blows upon him.
Perplexity: 574249920.0000

Sentence: “another gasconade!” murmured the gentleman.
Perplexity: 770218624.0000

Sentence: “by my honor, these gascons are incorrigible!
Perplexity: 407515744.0000

Sentence: keep up the dance, then, since he will have it so.
Perplexity: 105433280.0000

Sentence: when he is tired, he will perhaps tell us that he has had enough of it.” but the stranger knew not the headstrong personage he had to do with; d’artagnan was not the man ever to cry for quarter.
Perplexity: 407679776.0000

Sentence: the fight was therefore prolonged for some seconds; but at length d’artagnan dropped his sword, which was broken in two pieces by the blow of a stick.
Perplexity: 731490624.0000

Sentence: another blow full upon his forehead at the same moment brought him to the ground, covered with blood and almost fainting.

Perplexity: 263907056.0000

Sentence: perfectly safe and sound, my good host; and i wish to know what has become of our young man.” “he is better,” said the host, “he fainted quite away.” “indeed!” said the gentleman.
Perplexity: 1506212352.0000

Sentence: “but before he fainted, he collected all his strength to challenge you, and to defy you while challenging you.” “why, this fellow must be the devil in person!” cried the stranger.
Perplexity: 202009456.0000

Sentence: “oh, no, your excellency, he is not the devil,” replied the host, with a grin of contempt; “for during his fainting we rummaged his valise and found nothing but a clean shirt and eleven crowns—which however, did not prevent his saying, as he was fainting, that if such a thing had happened in paris, you should have cause to repent of it at a later period.” “then,” said the stranger coolly, “he must be some prince in disguise.” “i have told you this, good sir,” resumed the host, “in order that you may be on your guard.” “did he name no one in his passion?” “yes; he struck his pocket and said, ‘we shall see what monsieur de tréville will think of this insult offered to his _protégé_.’” “monsieur de tréville?” said the stranger, becoming attentive, “he put his hand upon his pocket while pronouncing the name of monsieur de tréville?
Perplexity: 84522080.0000

Sentence: now, my dear host, while your young man was insensible, you did not fail, i am quite sure, to ascertain what that pocket contained.
Perplexity: 180033184.0000

Sentence: what was there in it?” “a letter addressed to monsieur de tréville, captain of the musketeers.” “indeed!” “exactly as i have the honor to tell your excellency.” the host, who was not endowed with great perspicacity, did not observe the expression which his words had given to the physiognomy of the stranger.
Perplexity: 329380544.0000

Sentence: the latter rose from the front of the window, upon the sill of which he had leaned with his elbow, and knitted his brow like a man disquieted.

Perplexity: 152914048.0000

Sentence: “can tréville have set this gascon upon me?
Perplexity: 325310368.0000

Sentence: he is very young; but a sword thrust is a sword thrust, whatever be the age of him who gives it, and a youth is less to be suspected than an older man,” and the stranger fell into a reverie which lasted some minutes.
Perplexity: 512965600.0000

Sentence: “a weak obstacle is sometimes sufficient to overthrow a great design.
Perplexity: 1084712448.0000

Sentence: “host,” said he, “could you not contrive to get rid of this frantic boy for me?
Perplexity: 1624970496.0000

Sentence: in conscience, i cannot kill him; and yet,” added he, with a coldly menacing expression, “he annoys me.
Perplexity: 351614912.0000

Perplexity: 239079088.0000

Sentence: has he taken off his doublet?” “on the contrary, everything is in the kitchen.
Perplexity: 1726782336.0000

Sentence: but if he annoys you, this young fool—” “to be sure he does.
Perplexity: 1129961600.0000

Perplexity: 3678307840.0000

Perplexity: 234568064.0000

Sentence: have they not obeyed me?” “it is done; as your excellency may have observed, your horse is in the great gateway, ready saddled for your departure.” “that is well; do as i have directed you, then.” “what the devil!” said the host to himself.
Perplexity: 191340448.0000

Sentence: “can he be afraid of this boy?” but an imperious glance from the stranger stopped him short; he bowed humbly and retired.
Perplexity: 41503108.0000

Sentence: “it is not necessary for milady* to be seen by this fellow,” continued the stranger.
Perplexity: 478530688.0000

Sentence: i had better get on horseback, and go and meet her.
Perplexity: 1535913984.0000

Sentence: i should like, however, to know what this letter addressed to tréville contains.” and the stranger, muttering to himself, directed his steps toward the kitchen.
Perplexity: 240061984.0000

Sentence: * we are well aware that this term, milady, is only properly used when followed by a family name.
Perplexity: 1775391872.0000

Sentence: but we find it thus in the manuscript, and we do not choose to take upon ourselves to alter it.
Perplexity: 125094840.0000

Sentence: in the meantime, the host, who entertained no doubt that it was the presence of the young man that drove the stranger from his hostelry, re-ascended to his wife’s chamber, and found d’artagnan just recovering his senses.
Perplexity: 99311568.0000

Sentence: giving him to understand that the police would deal with him pretty severely for having sought a quarrel with a great lord—for in the opinion of the host the stranger could be nothing less than a great lord—he insisted that notwithstanding his weakness d’artagnan should get up and depart as quickly as possible.
Perplexity: 105234184.0000

Sentence: d’artagnan, half stupefied, without his doublet, and with his head bound up in a linen cloth, arose then, and urged by the host, began to descend the stairs; but on arriving at the kitchen, the first thing he saw was his antagonist talking calmly at the step of a heavy carriage, drawn by two large norman horses.
Perplexity: 230993520.0000

Sentence: his interlocutor, whose head appeared through the carriage window, was a woman of from twenty to two-and-twenty years.
Perplexity: 115662928.0000

Sentence: we have already observed with what rapidity d’artagnan seized the expression of a countenance.
Perplexity: 95391944.0000

Sentence: he perceived then, at a glance, that this woman was young and beautiful; and her style of beauty struck him more forcibly from its being totally different from that of the southern countries in which d’artagnan had hitherto resided.
Perplexity: 143539616.0000

Sentence: she was pale and fair, with long curls falling in profusion over her shoulders, had large, blue, languishing eyes, rosy lips, and hands of alabaster.
Perplexity: 74512272.0000

Perplexity: 954471360.0000

Perplexity: 174441904.0000

Sentence: “to return instantly to england, and to inform him as soon as the duke leaves london.” “and as to my other instructions?” asked the fair traveler.
Perplexity: 45263336.0000

Sentence: “they are contained in this box, which you will not open until you are on the other side of the channel.” “very well; and you—what will you do?” “i—i return to paris.” “what, without chastising this insolent boy?” asked the lady.
Perplexity: 174973056.0000

Sentence: the stranger was about to reply; but at the moment he opened his mouth, d’artagnan, who had heard all, precipitated himself over the threshold of the door.
Perplexity: 1566867456.0000

Sentence: “this insolent boy chastises others,” cried he; “and i hope that this time he whom he ought to chastise will not escape him as before.” “will not escape him?” replied the stranger, knitting his brow.
Perplexity: 573368896.0000

Sentence: “no; before a woman you would dare not fly, i presume?” “remember,” said milady, seeing the stranger lay his hand on his sword, “the least delay may ruin everything.” “you are right,” cried the gentleman; “begone then, on your part, and i will depart as quickly on mine.” and bowing to the lady, he sprang into his saddle, while her coachman applied his whip vigorously to his horses.
Perplexity: 98729296.0000

Sentence: the two interlocutors thus separated, taking opposite directions, at full gallop.
Perplexity: 1099814144.0000

Sentence: “pay him, booby!” cried the stranger to his servant, without checking the speed of his horse; and the man, after throwing two or three silver pieces at the foot of mine host, galloped after his master.
Perplexity: 147544848.0000

Sentence: “base coward!
Perplexity: 85258144.0000

Sentence: false gentleman!” cried d’artagnan, springing forward, in his turn, after the servant.
Perplexity: 1397356416.0000

Sentence: but his wound had rendered him too weak to support such an exertion.
Perplexity: 24316374.0000

Sentence: scarcely had he gone ten steps when his ears began to tingle, a faintness seized him, a cloud of blood passed over his eyes, and he fell in the middle of the street, crying still, “coward!
Perplexity: 402104096.0000

Sentence: coward!
Perplexity: 41214072.0000

Sentence: coward!” “he is a coward, indeed,” grumbled the host, drawing near to d’artagnan, and endeavoring by this little flattery to make up matters with the young man, as the heron of the fable did with the snail he had despised the evening before.
Perplexity: 29104332.0000

Sentence: “yes, a base coward,” murmured d’artagnan; “but she—she was very beautiful.” “what _she?_” demanded the host.
Perplexity: 2028206976.0000

Sentence: “milady,” faltered d’artagnan, and fainted a second time.
Perplexity: 77699088.0000

Perplexity: 269059808.0000

Sentence: there will be eleven crowns gained.” it is to be remembered that eleven crowns was just the sum that remained in d’artagnan’s purse.
Perplexity: 141867872.0000

Sentence: the host had reckoned upon eleven days of confinement at a crown a day, but he had reckoned without his guest.
Perplexity: 167155136.0000

Sentence: on the following morning at five o’clock d’artagnan arose, and descending to the kitchen without help, asked, among other ingredients the list of which has not come down to us, for some oil, some wine, and some rosemary, and with his mother’s recipe in his hand composed a balsam, with which he anointed his numerous wounds, replacing his bandages himself, and positively refusing the assistance of any doctor, d’artagnan walked about that same evening, and was almost cured by the morrow.
Perplexity: 655707712.0000

Sentence: but when the time came to pay for his rosemary, this oil, and the wine, the only expense the master had incurred, as he had preserved a strict abstinence—while on the contrary, the yellow horse, by the account of the hostler at least, had eaten three times as much as a horse of his size could reasonably be supposed to have done—d’artagnan found nothing in his pocket but his little old velvet purse with the eleven crowns it contained; for as to the letter addressed to m. de tréville, it had disappeared.
Perplexity: 61917108.0000

Sentence: the young man commenced his search for the letter with the greatest patience, turning out his pockets of all kinds over and over again, rummaging and rerummaging in his valise, and opening and reopening his purse; but when he found that he had come to the conviction that the letter was not to be found, he flew, for the third time, into such a rage as was near costing him a fresh consumption of wine, oil, and rosemary—for upon seeing this hot-headed youth become exasperated and threaten to destroy everything in the establishment if his letter were not found, the host seized a spit, his wife a broom handle, and the servants the same sticks they had used the day before.
Perplexity: 86062312.0000

Sentence: “my letter of recommendation!” cried d’artagnan, “my letter of recommendation!
Perplexity: 27533782.0000

Sentence: or, the holy blood, i will spit you all like ortolans!” unfortunately, there was one circumstance which created a powerful obstacle to the accomplishment of this threat; which was, as we have related, that his sword had been in his first conflict broken in two, and which he had entirely forgotten.
Perplexity: 79670880.0000

Sentence: hence, it resulted when d’artagnan proceeded to draw his sword in earnest, he found himself purely and simply armed with a stump of a sword about eight or ten inches in length, which the host had carefully placed in the scabbard.
Perplexity: 1788132480.0000

Sentence: as to the rest of the blade, the master had slyly put that on one side to make himself a larding pin.
Perplexity: 4117710592.0000

Sentence: but this deception would probably not have stopped our fiery young man if the host had not reflected that the reclamation which his guest made was perfectly just.
Perplexity: 90668408.0000

Sentence: “but, after all,” said he, lowering the point of his spit, “where is this letter?” “yes, where is this letter?” cried d’artagnan.
Perplexity: 228507552.0000

Sentence: “in the first place, i warn you that that letter is for monsieur de tréville, and it must be found, or if it is not found, he will know how to find it.” his threat completed the intimidation of the host.
Perplexity: 154121008.0000

Sentence: after the king and the cardinal, m. de tréville was the man whose name was perhaps most frequently repeated by the military, and even by citizens.
Perplexity: 569690944.0000

Sentence: there was, to be sure, father joseph, but his name was never pronounced but with a subdued voice, such was the terror inspired by his gray eminence, as the cardinal’s familiar was called.
Perplexity: 420624928.0000

Sentence: throwing down his spit, and ordering his wife to do the same with her broom handle, and the servants with their sticks, he set the first example of commencing an earnest search for the lost letter.
Perplexity: 27475236.0000

Sentence: “does the letter contain anything valuable?” demanded the host, after a few minutes of useless investigation.
Perplexity: 246702624.0000

Sentence: “zounds!
Perplexity: 199966208.0000

Sentence: i think it does indeed!” cried the gascon, who reckoned upon this letter for making his way at court.
Perplexity: 96670416.0000

Sentence: “it contained my fortune!” “bills upon spain?” asked the disturbed host.
Perplexity: 146350864.0000

Sentence: “bills upon his majesty’s private treasury,” answered d’artagnan, who, reckoning upon entering into the king’s service in consequence of this recommendation, believed he could make this somewhat hazardous reply without telling of a falsehood.
Perplexity: 1853316224.0000

Sentence: “the devil!” cried the host, at his wits’ end.
Perplexity: 421575904.0000

Sentence: “but it’s of no importance,” continued d’artagnan, with natural assurance; “it’s of no importance.
Perplexity: 324460800.0000

Sentence: the money is nothing; that letter was everything.
Perplexity: 241979888.0000

Sentence: i would rather have lost a thousand pistoles than have lost it.” he would not have risked more if he had said twenty thousand; but a certain juvenile modesty restrained him.
Perplexity: 107821016.0000

Sentence: a ray of light all at once broke upon the mind of the host as he was giving himself to the devil upon finding nothing.
Perplexity: 620718016.0000

Sentence: “that letter is not lost!” cried he.
Perplexity: 65408100.0000

Sentence: “what!” cried d’artagnan.
Perplexity: 2220291840.0000

Sentence: “no, it has been stolen from you.” “stolen?
Perplexity: 114465080.0000

Sentence: by whom?” “by the gentleman who was here yesterday.
Perplexity: 1275242368.0000

Sentence: he came down into the kitchen, where your doublet was.
Perplexity: 1169340160.0000

Sentence: he remained there some time alone.
Perplexity: 1721842432.0000

Sentence: i would lay a wager he has stolen it.” “do you think so?” answered d’artagnan, but little convinced, as he knew better than anyone else how entirely personal the value of this letter was, and saw nothing in it likely to tempt cupidity.
Perplexity: 2187976192.0000

Sentence: the fact was that none of his servants, none of the travelers present, could have gained anything by being possessed of this paper.
Perplexity: 438462400.0000

Sentence: “do you say,” resumed d’artagnan, “that you suspect that impertinent gentleman?” “i tell you i am sure of it,” continued the host.
Perplexity: 393641376.0000

Sentence: “when i informed him that your lordship was the _protégé_ of monsieur de tréville, and that you even had a letter for that illustrious gentleman, he appeared to be very much disturbed, and asked me where that letter was, and immediately came down into the kitchen, where he knew your doublet was.” “then that’s my thief,” replied d’artagnan.
Perplexity: 124604296.0000

Sentence: “i will complain to monsieur de tréville, and monsieur de tréville will complain to the king.” he then drew two crowns majestically from his purse and gave them to the host, who accompanied him, cap in hand, to the gate, and remounted his yellow horse, which bore him without any further accident to the gate of st. antoine at paris, where his owner sold him for three crowns, which was a very good price, considering that d’artagnan had ridden him hard during the last stage.
Perplexity: 54437348.0000

Sentence: thus the dealer to whom d’artagnan sold him for the nine livres did not conceal from the young man that he only gave that enormous sum for him on the account of the originality of his color.
Perplexity: 555145536.0000

Sentence: thus d’artagnan entered paris on foot, carrying his little packet under his arm, and walked about till he found an apartment to be let on terms suited to the scantiness of his means.
Perplexity: 82760744.0000

Sentence: this chamber was a sort of garret, situated in the rue des fossoyeurs, near the luxembourg.
Perplexity: 1296154880.0000

Sentence: as soon as the earnest money was paid, d’artagnan took possession of his lodging, and passed the remainder of the day in sewing onto his doublet and hose some ornamental braiding which his mother had taken off an almost-new doublet of the elder m. d’artagnan, and which she had given her son secretly.
Perplexity: 329327776.0000

Sentence: next he went to the quai de feraille to have a new blade put to his sword, and then returned toward the louvre, inquiring of the first musketeer he met for the situation of the hôtel of m. de tréville, which proved to be in the rue du vieux-colombier; that is to say, in the immediate vicinity of the chamber hired by d’artagnan—a circumstance which appeared to furnish a happy augury for the success of his journey.
Perplexity: 308506240.0000

Sentence: after this, satisfied with the way in which he had conducted himself at meung, without remorse for the past, confident in the present, and full of hope for the future, he retired to bed and slept the sleep of the brave.
Perplexity: 729442496.0000

Sentence: this sleep, provincial as it was, brought him to nine o’clock in the morning; at which hour he rose, in order to repair to the residence of m. de tréville, the third personage in the kingdom, in the paternal estimation.
Perplexity: 372564928.0000

Sentence: the antechamber of m. de tréville m. de troisville, as his family was still called in gascony, or m. de tréville, as he has ended by styling himself in paris, had really commenced life as d’artagnan now did; that is to say, without a sou in his pocket, but with a fund of audacity, shrewdness, and intelligence which makes the poorest gascon gentleman often derive more in his hope from the paternal inheritance than the richest perigordian or berrichan gentleman derives in reality from his.
Perplexity: 130806040.0000

Sentence: his insolent bravery, his still more insolent success at a time when blows poured down like hail, had borne him to the top of that difficult ladder called court favor, which he had climbed four steps at a time.

Sentence: the father of m. de tréville had served him so faithfully in his wars against the league that in default of money—a thing to which the béarnais was accustomed all his life, and who constantly paid his debts with that of which he never stood in need of borrowing, that is to say, with ready wit—in default of money, we repeat, he authorized him, after the reduction of paris, to assume for his arms a golden lion passant upon gules, with the motto _fidelis et fortis_.
Perplexity: 179950112.0000

Sentence: this was a great matter in the way of honor, but very little in the way of wealth; so that when the illustrious companion of the great henry died, the only inheritance he was able to leave his son was his sword and his motto.
Perplexity: 392433664.0000

Sentence: thanks to this double gift and the spotless name that accompanied it, m. de tréville was admitted into the household of the young prince where he made such good use of his sword, and was so faithful to his motto, that louis xiii., one of the good blades of his kingdom, was accustomed to say that if he had a friend who was about to fight, he would advise him to choose as a second, himself first, and tréville next—or even, perhaps, before himself.

Perplexity: 198533840.0000

Sentence: tréville was one of these latter.
Perplexity: 52514600.0000

Sentence: his was one of those rare organizations, endowed with an obedient intelligence like that of the dog; with a blind valor, a quick eye, and a prompt hand; to whom sight appeared only to be given to see if the king were dissatisfied with anyone, and the hand to strike this displeasing personage, whether a besme, a maurevers, a poltiot de méré, or a vitry.
Perplexity: 156102000.0000

Perplexity: 4258870528.0000

Sentence: i will go straight to the louvre; i will give in my resignation as captain of the king’s musketeers to take a lieutenancy in the cardinal’s guards, and if he refuses me, _morbleu!_ i will turn abbé.” at these words, the murmur without became an explosion; nothing was to be heard but oaths and blasphemies.

Perplexity: 510160384.0000

Perplexity: 105058696.0000

Sentence: he would be in despair if that should come to the ears of the king; and as the wound is very serious, seeing that after crossing the shoulder it penetrates into the chest, it is to be feared—” at this instant the tapestry was raised and a noble and handsome head, but frightfully pale, appeared under the fringe.

Sentence: “athos!” cried the two musketeers.
Perplexity: 172792144.0000

Perplexity: 198955744.0000

Sentence: your hand, athos!” and without waiting for the answer of the newcomer to this proof of affection, m. de tréville seized his right hand and pressed it with all his might, without perceiving that athos, whatever might be his self-command, allowed a slight murmur of pain to escape him, and if possible, grew paler than he was before.

Perplexity: 288713568.0000

Sentence: “i respected your father very much,” said he.
Perplexity: 50049700.0000

Perplexity: 169234592.0000

Sentence: tell me quickly; my time is not my own.” “monsieur,” said d’artagnan, “on quitting tarbes and coming hither, it was my intention to request of you, in remembrance of the friendship which you have not forgotten, the uniform of a musketeer; but after all that i have seen during the last two hours, i comprehend that such a favor is enormous, and tremble lest i should not merit it.” “it is indeed a favor, young man,” replied m. de tréville, “but it may not be so far beyond your hopes as you believe, or rather as you appear to believe.
Perplexity: 325685376.0000

Sentence: but his majesty’s decision is always necessary; and i inform you with regret that no one becomes a musketeer without the preliminary ordeal of several campaigns, certain brilliant actions, or a service of two years in some other regiment less favored than ours.” d’artagnan bowed without replying, feeling his desire to don the musketeer’s uniform vastly increased by the great difficulties which preceded the attainment of it.
Perplexity: 702196800.0000

Sentence: “but,” continued m. de tréville, fixing upon his compatriot a look so piercing that it might be said he wished to read the thoughts of his heart, “on account of my old companion, your father, as i have said, i will do something for you, young man.
Perplexity: 1959737216.0000

Sentence: our recruits from béarn are not generally very rich, and i have no reason to think matters have much changed in this respect since i left the province.
Perplexity: 162174336.0000

Perplexity: 52595392.0000

Sentence: i know these airs; i myself came to paris with four crowns in my purse, and would have fought with anyone who dared to tell me i was not in a condition to purchase the louvre.” d’artagnan’s bearing became still more imposing.

Sentence: you will make some desirable acquaintances; and from time to time you can call upon me, just to tell me how you are getting on, and to say whether i can be of further service to you.” d’artagnan, stranger as he was to all the manners of a court, could not but perceive a little coldness in this reception.
Perplexity: 84525312.0000

Sentence: “alas, sir,” said he, “i cannot but perceive how sadly i miss the letter of introduction which my father gave me to present to you.” “i certainly am surprised,” replied m. de tréville, “that you should undertake so long a journey without that necessary passport, the sole resource of us poor béarnese.” “i had one, sir, and, thank god, such as i could wish,” cried d’artagnan; “but it was perfidiously stolen from me.” he then related the adventure of meung, described the unknown gentleman with the greatest minuteness, and all with a warmth and truthfulness that delighted m. de tréville.
Perplexity: 78283544.0000

Sentence: “this is all very strange,” said m. de tréville, after meditating a minute; “you mentioned my name, then, aloud?” “yes, sir, i certainly committed that imprudence; but why should i have done otherwise?

Sentence: a name like yours must be as a buckler to me on my way.
Perplexity: 43028180.0000

Perplexity: 54543152.0000

Sentence: he could not refrain from a smile of visible satisfaction; but this smile soon disappeared, and returning to the adventure of meung, “tell me,” continued he, “had not this gentlemen a slight scar on his cheek?” “yes, such a one as would be made by the grazing of a ball.” “was he not a fine-looking man?” “yes.” “of lofty stature.” “yes.” “of pale complexion and brown hair?” “yes, yes, that is he; how is it, sir, that you are acquainted with this man?
Perplexity: 572204352.0000

Perplexity: 237296848.0000

Sentence: “he departed immediately after having conversed for a minute with her whom he awaited.” “you know not the subject of their conversation?” “he gave her a box, told her not to open it except in london.” “was this woman english?” “he called her milady.” “it is he; it must be he!” murmured tréville.
Perplexity: 788682368.0000

Sentence: “i believed him still at brussels.” “oh, sir, if you know who this man is,” cried d’artagnan, “tell me who he is, and whence he is.
Perplexity: 423233984.0000

Sentence: i will then release you from all your promises—even that of procuring my admission into the musketeers; for before everything, i wish to avenge myself.” “beware, young man!” cried tréville.
Perplexity: 164499312.0000

Sentence: “if you see him coming on one side of the street, pass by on the other.
Perplexity: 236539040.0000

Sentence: do not cast yourself against such a rock; he would break you like glass.” “that will not prevent me,” replied d’artagnan, “if ever i find him.” “in the meantime,” said tréville, “seek him not—if i have a right to advise you.” all at once the captain stopped, as if struck by a sudden suspicion.
Perplexity: 15601673216.0000

Sentence: this great hatred which the young traveler manifested so loudly for this man, who—a rather improbable thing—had stolen his father’s letter from him—was there not some perfidy concealed under this hatred?
Perplexity: 88224472.0000

Sentence: might not this young man be sent by his eminence?
Perplexity: 143449840.0000

Sentence: might he not have come for the purpose of laying a snare for him?
Perplexity: 1876779904.0000

Sentence: this pretended d’artagnan—was he not an emissary of the cardinal, whom the cardinal sought to introduce into tréville’s house, to place near him, to win his confidence, and afterward to ruin him as had been done in a thousand other instances?
Perplexity: 79335296.0000

Sentence: he fixed his eyes upon d’artagnan even more earnestly than before.
Perplexity: 18069602.0000

Sentence: he was moderately reassured, however, by the aspect of that countenance, full of astute intelligence and affected humility.
Perplexity: 547636544.0000

Sentence: “i know he is a gascon,” reflected he, “but he may be one for the cardinal as well as for me.
Perplexity: 109568672.0000

Sentence: let us try him.” “my friend,” said he, slowly, “i wish, as the son of an ancient friend—for i consider this story of the lost letter perfectly true—i wish, i say, in order to repair the coldness you may have remarked in my reception of you, to discover to you the secrets of our policy.
Perplexity: 410910976.0000

Sentence: the king and the cardinal are the best of friends; their apparent bickerings are only feints to deceive fools.
Perplexity: 239769584.0000

Sentence: i am not willing that a compatriot, a handsome cavalier, a brave youth, quite fit to make his way, should become the dupe of all these artifices and fall into the snare after the example of so many others who have been ruined by it.
Perplexity: 34428288.0000

Sentence: be assured that i am devoted to both these all-powerful masters, and that my earnest endeavors have no other aim than the service of the king, and also the cardinal—one of the most illustrious geniuses that france has ever produced.
Perplexity: 198349888.0000

Sentence: “now, young man, regulate your conduct accordingly; and if you entertain, whether from your family, your relations, or even from your instincts, any of these enmities which we see constantly breaking out against the cardinal, bid me adieu and let us separate.
Perplexity: 795851072.0000

Sentence: i will aid you in many ways, but without attaching you to my person.
Perplexity: 328686464.0000

Sentence: i hope that my frankness at least will make you my friend; for you are the only young man to whom i have hitherto spoken as i have done to you.” tréville said to himself: “if the cardinal has set this young fox upon me, he will certainly not have failed—he, who knows how bitterly i execrate him—to tell his spy that the best means of making his court to me is to rail at him.
Perplexity: 214276016.0000

Sentence: therefore, in spite of all my protestations, if it be as i suspect, my cunning gossip will assure me that he holds his eminence in horror.” it, however, proved otherwise.
Perplexity: 417023776.0000

Sentence: d’artagnan answered, with the greatest simplicity: “i came to paris with exactly such intentions.
Perplexity: 445799776.0000

Sentence: my father advised me to stoop to nobody but the king, the cardinal, and yourself—whom he considered the first three personages in france.” d’artagnan added m. de tréville to the others, as may be perceived; but he thought this addition would do no harm.
Perplexity: 184431248.0000

Sentence: “i have the greatest veneration for the cardinal,” continued he, “and the most profound respect for his actions.
Perplexity: 113252864.0000

Sentence: so much the better for me, sir, if you speak to me, as you say, with frankness—for then you will do me the honor to esteem the resemblance of our opinions; but if you have entertained any doubt, as naturally you may, i feel that i am ruining myself by speaking the truth.
Perplexity: 741953472.0000

Sentence: but i still trust you will not esteem me the less for it, and that is my object beyond all others.” m. de tréville was surprised to the greatest degree.
Perplexity: 61031512.0000

Sentence: so much penetration, so much frankness, created admiration, but did not entirely remove his suspicions.
Perplexity: 462965536.0000

Sentence: the more this young man was superior to others, the more he was to be dreaded if he meant to deceive him.
Perplexity: 521029728.0000

Sentence: nevertheless, he pressed d’artagnan’s hand, and said to him: “you are an honest youth; but at the present moment i can only do for you that which i just now offered.
Perplexity: 221593744.0000

Sentence: my hôtel will be always open to you.
Perplexity: 531396320.0000

Sentence: hereafter, being able to ask for me at all hours, and consequently to take advantage of all opportunities, you will probably obtain that which you desire.” “that is to say,” replied d’artagnan, “that you will wait until i have proved myself worthy of it.
Perplexity: 1782683904.0000

Sentence: well, be assured,” added he, with the familiarity of a gascon, “you shall not wait long.” and he bowed in order to retire, and as if he considered the future in his own hands.

Sentence: “but wait a minute,” said m. de tréville, stopping him.
Perplexity: 184229088.0000

Sentence: “i promised you a letter for the director of the academy.
Perplexity: 618610688.0000

Sentence: are you too proud to accept it, young gentleman?” “no, sir,” said d’artagnan; “and i will guard it so carefully that i will be sworn it shall arrive at its address, and woe be to him who shall attempt to take it from me!” m. de tréville smiled at this flourish; and leaving his young man compatriot in the embrasure of the window, where they had talked together, he seated himself at a table in order to write the promised letter of recommendation.
Perplexity: 904233920.0000

Sentence: while he was doing this, d’artagnan, having no better employment, amused himself with beating a march upon the window and with looking at the musketeers, who went away, one after another, following them with his eyes until they disappeared.
Perplexity: 137573632.0000

Sentence: m. de tréville, after having written the letter, sealed it, and rising, approached the young man in order to give it to him.
Perplexity: 121750344.0000

Sentence: but at the very moment when d’artagnan stretched out his hand to receive it, m. de tréville was highly astonished to see his _protégé_ make a sudden spring, become crimson with passion, and rush from the cabinet crying, “s’blood, he shall not escape me this time!” “and who?” asked m. de tréville.
Perplexity: 1995791616.0000

Sentence: “he, my thief!” replied d’artagnan.
Perplexity: 466757728.0000

Sentence: “ah, the traitor!” and he disappeared.
Perplexity: 299064704.0000

Sentence: the shoulder of athos, the baldric of porthos and the handkerchief of aramis d’artagnan, in a state of fury, crossed the antechamber at three bounds, and was darting toward the stairs, which he reckoned upon descending four at a time, when, in his heedless course, he ran head foremost against a musketeer who was coming out of one of m. de tréville’s private rooms, and striking his shoulder violently, made him utter a cry, or rather a howl.
Perplexity: 863341376.0000

Sentence: “excuse me,” said d’artagnan, endeavoring to resume his course, “excuse me, but i am in a hurry.” scarcely had he descended the first stair, when a hand of iron seized him by the belt and stopped him.
Perplexity: 72304256.0000

Sentence: “you are in a hurry?” said the musketeer, as pale as a sheet.
Perplexity: 656380928.0000

Sentence: “under that pretense you run against me!
Perplexity: 214186528.0000

Sentence: you say, ‘excuse me,’ and you believe that is sufficient?
Perplexity: 44895592.0000

Sentence: not at all, my young man.
Perplexity: 958832320.0000

Sentence: do you fancy because you have heard monsieur de tréville speak to us a little cavalierly today that other people are to treat us as he speaks to us?
Perplexity: 506824064.0000

Sentence: undeceive yourself, comrade, you are not monsieur de tréville.” “my faith!” replied d’artagnan, recognizing athos, who, after the dressing performed by the doctor, was returning to his own apartment.
Perplexity: 23141984.0000

Sentence: “i did not do it intentionally, and not doing it intentionally, i said ‘excuse me.’ it appears to me that this is quite enough.
Perplexity: 934150016.0000

Sentence: i repeat to you, however, and this time on my word of honor—i think perhaps too often—that i am in haste, great haste.
Perplexity: 770818240.0000

Sentence: leave your hold, then, i beg of you, and let me go where my business calls me.” “monsieur,” said athos, letting him go, “you are not polite; it is easy to perceive that you come from a distance.” d’artagnan had already strode down three or four stairs, but at athos’s last remark he stopped short.
Perplexity: 102311728.0000

Sentence: “_morbleu_, monsieur!” said he, “however far i may come, it is not you who can give me a lesson in good manners, i warn you.” “perhaps,” said athos.
Perplexity: 58846440.0000

Sentence: “ah!
Perplexity: 51662688.0000

Perplexity: 76720368.0000

Sentence: “monsieur man-in-a-hurry, you can find me without running—_me_, you understand?” “and where, i pray you?” “near the carmes-deschaux.” “at what hour?” “about noon.” “about noon?
Perplexity: 1126273536.0000

Sentence: that will do; i will be there.” “endeavor not to make me wait; for at quarter past twelve i will cut off your ears as you run.” “good!” cried d’artagnan, “i will be there ten minutes before twelve.” and he set off running as if the devil possessed him, hoping that he might yet find the stranger, whose slow pace could not have carried him far.
Perplexity: 73718656.0000

Sentence: but at the street gate, porthos was talking with the soldier on guard.

Perplexity: 1112506752.0000

Sentence: without doubt, porthos had reasons for not abandoning this part of his vestments, for instead of quitting his hold on the flap in his hand, he pulled it toward him, so that d’artagnan rolled himself up in the velvet by a movement of rotation explained by the persistency of porthos.
Perplexity: 1070450688.0000

Sentence: d’artagnan, hearing the musketeer swear, wished to escape from the cloak, which blinded him, and sought to find his way from under the folds of it.
Perplexity: 213463824.0000

Sentence: he was particularly anxious to avoid marring the freshness of the magnificent baldric we are acquainted with; but on timidly opening his eyes, he found himself with his nose fixed between the two shoulders of porthos—that is to say, exactly upon the baldric.
Perplexity: 139698800.0000

Sentence: alas, like most things in this world which have nothing in their favor but appearances, the baldric was glittering with gold in the front, but was nothing but simple buff behind.
Perplexity: 73123352.0000

Sentence: vainglorious as he was, porthos could not afford to have a baldric wholly of gold, but had at least half.
Perplexity: 3315989248.0000

Sentence: one could comprehend the necessity of the cold and the urgency of the cloak.
Perplexity: 401621184.0000

Sentence: “bless me!” cried porthos, making strong efforts to disembarrass himself of d’artagnan, who was wriggling about his back; “you must be mad to run against people in this manner.” “excuse me,” said d’artagnan, reappearing under the shoulder of the giant, “but i am in such haste—i was running after someone and—” “and do you always forget your eyes when you run?” asked porthos.
Perplexity: 221110320.0000

Sentence: “no,” replied d’artagnan, piqued, “and thanks to my eyes, i can see what other people cannot see.” whether porthos understood him or did not understand him, giving way to his anger, “monsieur,” said he, “you stand a chance of getting chastised if you rub musketeers in this fashion.” “chastised, monsieur!” said d’artagnan, “the expression is strong.” “it is one that becomes a man accustomed to look his enemies in the face.” “ah, _pardieu!_ i know full well that you don’t turn your back to yours.” and the young man, delighted with his joke, went away laughing loudly.
Perplexity: 1595471872.0000

Sentence: porthos foamed with rage, and made a movement to rush after d’artagnan.
Perplexity: 256279744.0000

Sentence: “presently, presently,” cried the latter, “when you haven’t your cloak on.” “at one o’clock, then, behind the luxembourg.” “very well, at one o’clock, then,” replied d’artagnan, turning the angle of the street.
Perplexity: 66300780.0000

Sentence: but neither in the street he had passed through, nor in the one which his eager glance pervaded, could he see anyone; however slowly the stranger had walked, he was gone on his way, or perhaps had entered some house.
Perplexity: 202025632.0000

Sentence: d’artagnan inquired of everyone he met with, went down to the ferry, came up again by the rue de seine, and the red cross; but nothing, absolutely nothing!
Perplexity: 70979648.0000

Sentence: this chase was, however, advantageous to him in one sense, for in proportion as the perspiration broke from his forehead, his heart began to cool.
Perplexity: 2642537472.0000

Sentence: he began to reflect upon the events that had passed; they were numerous and inauspicious.
Perplexity: 26652370.0000

Sentence: it was scarcely eleven o’clock in the morning, and yet this morning had already brought him into disgrace with m. de tréville, who could not fail to think the manner in which d’artagnan had left him a little cavalier.
Perplexity: 485496608.0000

Sentence: besides this, he had drawn upon himself two good duels with two men, each capable of killing three d’artagnans—with two musketeers, in short, with two of those beings whom he esteemed so greatly that he placed them in his mind and heart above all other men.
Perplexity: 102641272.0000

Sentence: the outlook was sad.
Perplexity: 134783856.0000

Sentence: sure of being killed by athos, it may easily be understood that the young man was not very uneasy about porthos.
Perplexity: 322155744.0000

Sentence: as hope, however, is the last thing extinguished in the heart of man, he finished by hoping that he might survive, even though with terrible wounds, in both these duels; and in case of surviving, he made the following reprehensions upon his own conduct: “what a madcap i was, and what a stupid fellow i am!
Perplexity: 60604284.0000

Sentence: that brave and unfortunate athos was wounded on that very shoulder against which i must run head foremost, like a ram.
Perplexity: 98232456.0000

Sentence: the only thing that astonishes me is that he did not strike me dead at once.
Perplexity: 89163688.0000

Sentence: he had good cause to do so; the pain i gave him must have been atrocious.
Perplexity: 179032944.0000

Sentence: as to porthos—oh, as to porthos, faith, that’s a droll affair!” and in spite of himself, the young man began to laugh aloud, looking round carefully, however, to see that his solitary laugh, without a cause in the eyes of passers-by, offended no one.
Perplexity: 805897600.0000

Sentence: “as to porthos, that is certainly droll; but i am not the less a giddy fool.
Perplexity: 576316096.0000

Sentence: are people to be run against without warning?
Perplexity: 823092992.0000

Sentence: no!
Perplexity: 290518784.0000

Sentence: and have i any right to go and peep under their cloaks to see what is not there?
Perplexity: 116403672.0000

Sentence: he would have pardoned me, he would certainly have pardoned me, if i had not said anything to him about that cursed baldric—in ambiguous words, it is true, but rather drolly ambiguous.
Perplexity: 118306696.0000

Sentence: ah, cursed gascon that i am, i get from one hobble into another.
Perplexity: 230462800.0000

Sentence: friend d’artagnan,” continued he, speaking to himself with all the amenity that he thought due himself, “if you escape, of which there is not much chance, i would advise you to practice perfect politeness for the future.
Perplexity: 174886976.0000

Sentence: you must henceforth be admired and quoted as a model of it.
Perplexity: 136886288.0000

Sentence: to be obliging and polite does not necessarily make a man a coward.
Perplexity: 38276992.0000

Sentence: look at aramis, now; aramis is mildness and grace personified.
Perplexity: 65122416.0000

Sentence: well, did anybody ever dream of calling aramis a coward?
Perplexity: 336073728.0000

Sentence: no, certainly not, and from this moment i will endeavor to model myself after him.
Perplexity: 43622492.0000

Sentence: ah!
Perplexity: 344041536.0000

Sentence: that’s strange!
Perplexity: 3375945984.0000

Sentence: here he is!” d’artagnan, walking and soliloquizing, had arrived within a few steps of the hôtel d’arguillon and in front of that hôtel perceived aramis, chatting gaily with three gentlemen; but as he had not forgotten that it was in presence of this young man that m. de tréville had been so angry in the morning, and as a witness of the rebuke the musketeers had received was not likely to be at all agreeable, he pretended not to see him.
Perplexity: 904049472.0000

Sentence: d’artagnan, on the contrary, quite full of his plans of conciliation and courtesy, approached the young men with a profound bow, accompanied by a most gracious smile.
Perplexity: 31224390.0000

Sentence: all four, besides, immediately broke off their conversation.
Perplexity: 344921952.0000

Sentence: d’artagnan was not so dull as not to perceive that he was one too many; but he was not sufficiently broken into the fashions of the gay world to know how to extricate himself gallantly from a false position, like that of a man who begins to mingle with people he is scarcely acquainted with and in a conversation that does not concern him.
Perplexity: 180395824.0000

Sentence: he was seeking in his mind, then, for the least awkward means of retreat, when he remarked that aramis had let his handkerchief fall, and by mistake, no doubt, had placed his foot upon it.
Perplexity: 176466192.0000

Sentence: this appeared to be a favorable opportunity to repair his intrusion.
Perplexity: 985023168.0000

Sentence: he stooped, and with the most gracious air he could assume, drew the handkerchief from under the foot of the musketeer in spite of the efforts the latter made to detain it, and holding it out to him, said, “i believe, monsieur, that this is a handkerchief you would be sorry to lose?” the handkerchief was indeed richly embroidered, and had a coronet and arms at one of its corners.
Perplexity: 214785840.0000

Sentence: aramis blushed excessively, and snatched rather than took the handkerchief from the hand of the gascon.
Perplexity: 94210664.0000

Sentence: “ah, ah!” cried one of the guards, “will you persist in saying, most discreet aramis, that you are not on good terms with madame de bois-tracy, when that gracious lady has the kindness to lend you one of her handkerchiefs?” aramis darted at d’artagnan one of those looks which inform a man that he has acquired a mortal enemy.
Perplexity: 160545936.0000

Sentence: then, resuming his mild air, “you are deceived, gentlemen,” said he, “this handkerchief is not mine, and i cannot fancy why monsieur has taken it into his head to offer it to me rather than to one of you; and as a proof of what i say, here is mine in my pocket.” so saying, he pulled out his own handkerchief, likewise a very elegant handkerchief, and of fine cambric—though cambric was dear at the period—but a handkerchief without embroidery and without arms, only ornamented with a single cipher, that of its proprietor.
Perplexity: 498914144.0000

Sentence: this time d’artagnan was not hasty.
Perplexity: 232874064.0000

Sentence: he perceived his mistake; but the friends of aramis were not at all convinced by his denial, and one of them addressed the young musketeer with affected seriousness.
Perplexity: 338115104.0000

Sentence: “if it were as you pretend it is,” said he, “i should be forced, my dear aramis, to reclaim it myself; for, as you very well know, bois-tracy is an intimate friend of mine, and i cannot allow the property of his wife to be sported as a trophy.” “you make the demand badly,” replied aramis; “and while acknowledging the justice of your reclamation, i refuse it on account of the form.” “the fact is,” hazarded d’artagnan, timidly, “i did not see the handkerchief fall from the pocket of monsieur aramis.
Perplexity: 286619264.0000

Sentence: he had his foot upon it, that is all; and i thought from having his foot upon it the handkerchief was his.” “and you were deceived, my dear sir,” replied aramis, coldly, very little sensible to the reparation.
Perplexity: 47288504.0000

Sentence: then turning toward that one of the guards who had declared himself the friend of bois-tracy, “besides,” continued he, “i have reflected, my dear intimate of bois-tracy, that i am not less tenderly his friend than you can possibly be; so that decidedly this handkerchief is as likely to have fallen from your pocket as mine.” “no, upon my honor!” cried his majesty’s guardsman.
Perplexity: 88040400.0000

Sentence: “you are about to swear upon your honor and i upon my word, and then it will be pretty evident that one of us will have lied.
Perplexity: 25574932.0000

Sentence: now, here, montaran, we will do better than that—let each take a half.” “of the handkerchief?” “yes.” “perfectly just,” cried the other two guardsmen, “the judgment of king solomon!
Perplexity: 141275712.0000

Sentence: aramis, you certainly are full of wisdom!” the young men burst into a laugh, and as may be supposed, the affair had no other sequel.
Perplexity: 2593220864.0000

Sentence: in a moment or two the conversation ceased, and the three guardsmen and the musketeer, after having cordially shaken hands, separated, the guardsmen going one way and aramis another.
Perplexity: 101259880.0000

Sentence: “now is my time to make peace with this gallant man,” said d’artagnan to himself, having stood on one side during the whole of the latter part of the conversation; and with this good feeling drawing near to aramis, who was departing without paying any attention to him, “monsieur,” said he, “you will excuse me, i hope.” “ah, monsieur,” interrupted aramis, “permit me to observe to you that you have not acted in this affair as a gallant man ought.” “what, monsieur!” cried d’artagnan, “and do you suppose—” “i suppose, monsieur, that you are not a fool, and that you knew very well, although coming from gascony, that people do not tread upon handkerchiefs without a reason.
Perplexity: 94632624.0000

Sentence: what the devil!
Perplexity: 4522247680.0000

Sentence: paris is not paved with cambric!” “monsieur, you act wrongly in endeavoring to mortify me,” said d’artagnan, in whom the natural quarrelsome spirit began to speak more loudly than his pacific resolutions.
Perplexity: 332946144.0000

Sentence: “i am from gascony, it is true; and since you know it, there is no occasion to tell you that gascons are not very patient, so that when they have begged to be excused once, were it even for a folly, they are convinced that they have done already at least as much again as they ought to have done.” “monsieur, what i say to you about the matter,” said aramis, “is not for the sake of seeking a quarrel.
Perplexity: 367651744.0000

Sentence: thank god, i am not a bravo!
Perplexity: 2103798784.0000

Sentence: and being a musketeer but for a time, i only fight when i am forced to do so, and always with great repugnance; but this time the affair is serious, for here is a lady compromised by you.” “by _us_, you mean!” cried d’artagnan.
Perplexity: 1666296832.0000

Sentence: “why did you so maladroitly restore me the handkerchief?” “why did you so awkwardly let it fall?” “i have said, monsieur, and i repeat, that the handkerchief did not fall from my pocket.” “and thereby you have lied twice, monsieur, for i saw it fall.” “ah, you take it with that tone, do you, master gascon?
Perplexity: 738146560.0000

Sentence: well, i will teach you how to behave yourself.” “and i will send you back to your mass book, master abbé.
Perplexity: 588649920.0000

Sentence: draw, if you please, and instantly—” “not so, if you please, my good friend—not here, at least.
Perplexity: 2796340224.0000

Sentence: do you not perceive that we are opposite the hôtel d’arguillon, which is full of the cardinal’s creatures?
Perplexity: 17924674.0000

Sentence: how do i know that this is not his eminence who has honored you with the commission to procure my head?
Perplexity: 154816320.0000

Sentence: now, i entertain a ridiculous partiality for my head, it seems to suit my shoulders so correctly.
Perplexity: 61411248.0000

Sentence: i wish to kill you, be at rest as to that, but to kill you quietly in a snug, remote place, where you will not be able to boast of your death to anybody.” “i agree, monsieur; but do not be too confident.
Perplexity: 75091088.0000

Sentence: take your handkerchief; whether it belongs to you or another, you may perhaps stand in need of it.” “monsieur is a gascon?” asked aramis.
Perplexity: 77137528.0000

Sentence: “yes.
Perplexity: 79906920.0000

Sentence: monsieur does not postpone an interview through prudence?” “prudence, monsieur, is a virtue sufficiently useless to musketeers, i know, but indispensable to churchmen; and as i am only a musketeer provisionally, i hold it good to be prudent.
Perplexity: 191058544.0000

Sentence: at two o’clock i shall have the honor of expecting you at the hôtel of monsieur de tréville.
Perplexity: 2534004224.0000

Sentence: he went therefore to his appointment with athos without a second, determined to be satisfied with those his adversary should choose.
Perplexity: 35128628.0000

Sentence: besides, his intention was formed to make the brave musketeer all suitable apologies, but without meanness or weakness, fearing that might result from this duel which generally results from an affair of this kind, when a young and vigorous man fights with an adversary who is wounded and weakened—if conquered, he doubles the triumph of his antagonist; if a conqueror, he is accused of foul play and want of courage.
Perplexity: 301928128.0000

Sentence: now, we must have badly painted the character of our adventure seeker, or our readers must have already perceived that d’artagnan was not an ordinary man; therefore, while repeating to himself that his death was inevitable, he did not make up his mind to die quietly, as one less courageous and less restrained might have done in his place.
Perplexity: 135955792.0000

Sentence: he reflected upon the different characters of those with whom he was going to fight, and began to view his situation more clearly.
Perplexity: 243953136.0000

Sentence: he hoped, by means of loyal excuses, to make a friend of athos, whose lordly air and austere bearing pleased him much.
Perplexity: 400473792.0000

Sentence: he flattered himself he should be able to frighten porthos with the adventure of the baldric, which he might, if not killed upon the spot, relate to everybody a recital which, well managed, would cover porthos with ridicule.
Perplexity: 291490144.0000

Sentence: as to the astute aramis, he did not entertain much dread of him; and supposing he should be able to get so far, he determined to dispatch him in good style or at least, by hitting him in the face, as cæsar recommended his soldiers do to those of pompey, to damage forever the beauty of which he was so proud.
Perplexity: 1777238400.0000

Sentence: in addition to this, d’artagnan possessed that invincible stock of resolution which the counsels of his father had implanted in his heart: “endure nothing from anyone but the king, the cardinal, and monsieur de tréville.” he flew, then, rather than walked, toward the convent of the carmes déchaussés, or rather deschaux, as it was called at that period, a sort of building without a window, surrounded by barren fields—an accessory to the preaux-clercs, and which was generally employed as the place for the duels of men who had no time to lose.
Perplexity: 51074140.0000

Sentence: when d’artagnan arrived in sight of the bare spot of ground which extended along the foot of the monastery, athos had been waiting about five minutes, and twelve o’clock was striking.
Perplexity: 1624725632.0000

Sentence: he was, then, as punctual as the samaritan woman, and the most rigorous casuist with regard to duels could have nothing to say.
Perplexity: 86400640.0000

Sentence: athos, who still suffered grievously from his wound, though it had been dressed anew by m. de tréville’s surgeon, was seated on a post and waiting for his adversary with hat in hand, his feather even touching the ground.
Perplexity: 312007104.0000

Sentence: “monsieur,” said athos, “i have engaged two of my friends as seconds; but these two friends are not yet come, at which i am astonished, as it is not at all their custom.” “i have no seconds on my part, monsieur,” said d’artagnan; “for having only arrived yesterday in paris, i as yet know no one but monsieur de tréville, to whom i was recommended by my father, who has the honor to be, in some degree, one of his friends.” athos reflected for an instant.
Perplexity: 381670752.0000

Sentence: “you know no one but monsieur de tréville?” he asked.
Perplexity: 522206688.0000

Sentence: “yes, monsieur, i know only him.” “well, but then,” continued athos, speaking half to himself, “if i kill you, i shall have the air of a boy-slayer.” “not too much so,” replied d’artagnan, with a bow that was not deficient in dignity, “since you do me the honor to draw a sword with me while suffering from a wound which is very inconvenient.” “very inconvenient, upon my word; and you hurt me devilishly, i can tell you.
Perplexity: 296582880.0000

Sentence: but i will take the left hand—it is my custom in such circumstances.
Perplexity: 1915998336.0000

Sentence: do not fancy that i do you a favor; i use either hand easily.
Perplexity: 722872000.0000

Sentence: and it will be even a disadvantage to you; a left-handed man is very troublesome to people who are not prepared for it.
Perplexity: 182868304.0000

Sentence: i regret i did not inform you sooner of this circumstance.” “you have truly, monsieur,” said d’artagnan, bowing again, “a courtesy, for which, i assure you, i am very grateful.” “you confuse me,” replied athos, with his gentlemanly air; “let us talk of something else, if you please.
Perplexity: 461007584.0000

Sentence: ah, s’blood, how you have hurt me!
Perplexity: 687133824.0000

Sentence: my shoulder quite burns.” “if you would permit me—” said d’artagnan, with timidity.
Perplexity: 17924674.0000

Sentence: “what, monsieur?” “i have a miraculous balsam for wounds—a balsam given to me by my mother and of which i have made a trial upon myself.” “well?” “well, i am sure that in less than three days this balsam would cure you; and at the end of three days, when you would be cured—well, sir, it would still do me a great honor to be your man.” d’artagnan spoke these words with a simplicity that did honor to his courtesy, without throwing the least doubt upon his courage.
Perplexity: 341228128.0000

Sentence: “_pardieu_, monsieur!” said athos, “that’s a proposition that pleases me; not that i can accept it, but a league off it savors of the gentleman.
Perplexity: 45289936.0000

Sentence: thus spoke and acted the gallant knights of the time of charlemagne, in whom every cavalier ought to seek his model.
Perplexity: 118772224.0000

Sentence: unfortunately, we do not live in the times of the great emperor, we live in the times of the cardinal; and three days hence, however well the secret might be guarded, it would be known, i say, that we were to fight, and our combat would be prevented.
Perplexity: 118047248.0000

Sentence: i think these fellows will never come.” “if you are in haste, monsieur,” said d’artagnan, with the same simplicity with which a moment before he had proposed to him to put off the duel for three days, “and if it be your will to dispatch me at once, do not inconvenience yourself, i pray you.” “there is another word which pleases me,” cried athos, with a gracious nod to d’artagnan.
Perplexity: 77843272.0000

Sentence: “that did not come from a man without a heart.
Perplexity: 191058544.0000

Sentence: monsieur, i love men of your kidney; and i foresee plainly that if we don’t kill each other, i shall hereafter have much pleasure in your conversation.
Perplexity: 583617984.0000

Sentence: we will wait for these gentlemen, so please you; i have plenty of time, and it will be more correct.
Perplexity: 399548320.0000

Sentence: ah, here is one of them, i believe.” in fact, at the end of the rue vaugirard the gigantic porthos appeared.
Perplexity: 134972688.0000

Sentence: “what!” cried d’artagnan, “is your first witness monsieur porthos?” “yes, that disturbs you?” “by no means.” “and here is the second.” d’artagnan turned in the direction pointed to by athos, and perceived aramis.
Perplexity: 75285128.0000

Sentence: “what!” cried he, in an accent of greater astonishment than before, “your second witness is monsieur aramis?” “doubtless!
Perplexity: 70624080.0000

Sentence: are you not aware that we are never seen one without the others, and that we are called among the musketeers and the guards, at court and in the city, athos, porthos, and aramis, or the three inseparables?

Sentence: and yet, as you come from dax or pau—” “from tarbes,” said d’artagnan.
Perplexity: 33184410.0000

Sentence: “it is probable you are ignorant of this little fact,” said athos.
Perplexity: 1014983552.0000

Sentence: “my faith!” replied d’artagnan, “you are well named, gentlemen; and my adventure, if it should make any noise, will prove at least that your union is not founded upon contrasts.” in the meantime, porthos had come up, waved his hand to athos, and then turning toward d’artagnan, stood quite astonished.
Perplexity: 217929520.0000

Sentence: let us say in passing that he had changed his baldric and relinquished his cloak.
Perplexity: 263876352.0000

Sentence: “ah, ah!” said he, “what does this mean?” “this is the gentleman i am going to fight with,” said athos, pointing to d’artagnan with his hand and saluting him with the same gesture.
Perplexity: 1898406528.0000

Sentence: “why, it is with him i am also going to fight,” said porthos.
Perplexity: 300633472.0000

Perplexity: 92537664.0000

Sentence: “but not until two o’clock,” said d’artagnan, with the same calmness.

Perplexity: 1949358336.0000

Sentence: i am going to fight—because i am going to fight,” answered porthos, reddening.
Perplexity: 3005189632.0000

Sentence: athos, whose keen eye lost nothing, perceived a faintly sly smile pass over the lips of the young gascon as he replied, “we had a short discussion upon dress.” “and you, aramis?” asked athos.
Perplexity: 113070264.0000

Sentence: “oh, ours is a theological quarrel,” replied aramis, making a sign to d’artagnan to keep secret the cause of their duel.
Perplexity: 59513192.0000

Sentence: athos indeed saw a second smile on the lips of d’artagnan.
Perplexity: 737852352.0000

Sentence: “indeed?” said athos.

Perplexity: 286690304.0000

Sentence: “and now you are assembled, gentlemen,” said d’artagnan, “permit me to offer you my apologies.” at this word _apologies_, a cloud passed over the brow of athos, a haughty smile curled the lip of porthos, and a negative sign was the reply of aramis.
Perplexity: 3674829824.0000

Sentence: “you do not understand me, gentlemen,” said d’artagnan, throwing up his head, the sharp and bold lines of which were at the moment gilded by a bright ray of the sun.
Perplexity: 90255176.0000

Sentence: “i asked to be excused in case i should not be able to discharge my debt to all three; for monsieur athos has the right to kill me first, which must much diminish the face-value of your bill, monsieur porthos, and render yours almost null, monsieur aramis.
Perplexity: 458622048.0000

Sentence: and now, gentlemen, i repeat, excuse me, but on that account only, and—on guard!” at these words, with the most gallant air possible, d’artagnan drew his sword.
Perplexity: 563754432.0000

Perplexity: 15592808448.0000

Sentence: and the edicts?
Perplexity: 255537328.0000

Sentence: what is become of them?” “you are very generous, gentlemen of the guards,” said athos, full of rancor, for jussac was one of the aggressors of the preceding day.

Perplexity: 45107516.0000

Sentence: “we will charge upon you, then,” said he, “if you disobey.” “there are five of them,” said athos, half aloud, “and we are but three; we shall be beaten again, and must die on the spot, for, on my part, i declare i will never appear again before the captain as a conquered man.” athos, porthos, and aramis instantly drew near one another, while jussac drew up his soldiers.
Perplexity: 287945824.0000

Perplexity: 495191136.0000

Sentence: to fight, that was to disobey the law, that was to risk his head, that was to make at one blow an enemy of a minister more powerful than the king himself.

Perplexity: 1926214144.0000

Perplexity: 67433688.0000

Sentence: “you may retire; we consent to that.
Perplexity: 153306816.0000

Perplexity: 2099593728.0000

Sentence: jussac was, as was then said, a fine blade, and had had much practice; nevertheless it required all his skill to defend himself against an adversary who, active and energetic, departed every instant from received rules, attacking him on all sides at once, and yet parrying like a man who had the greatest respect for his own epidermis.

Sentence: it was time; for athos, whose great courage alone supported him, sank upon his knee.

Perplexity: 1705219840.0000

Perplexity: 859573696.0000

Perplexity: 417650240.0000

Perplexity: 494235264.0000

Sentence: the king therefore arose a minute after, and putting the money which lay before him into his pocket, the major part of which arose from his winnings, “la vieuville,” said he, “take my place; i must speak to monsieur de tréville on an affair of importance.

Perplexity: 388358368.0000

Sentence: the party was to take place at st. germain, i believe, and they had appointed to meet at the carmes-deschaux, when they were disturbed by de jussac, cahusac, bicarat, and two other guardsmen, who certainly did not go there in such a numerous company without some ill intention against the edicts.” “ah, ah!

Perplexity: 2186211328.0000

Sentence: but all this will come to an end, tréville, will come to an end.
Perplexity: 18471878.0000

Perplexity: 303565184.0000

Sentence: they had a youth with them?” “yes, sire, and one wounded man; so that three of the king’s musketeers—one of whom was wounded—and a youth not only maintained their ground against five of the most terrible of the cardinal’s guardsmen, but absolutely brought four of them to earth.” “why, this is a victory!” cried the king, all radiant, “a complete victory!” “yes, sire; as complete as that of the bridge of ce.” “four men, one of them wounded, and a youth, say you?” “one hardly a young man; but who, however, behaved himself so admirably on this occasion that i will take the liberty of recommending him to your majesty.” “how does he call himself?” “d’artagnan, sire; he is the son of one of my oldest friends—the son of a man who served under the king your father, of glorious memory, in the civil war.” “and you say this young man behaved himself well?

Perplexity: 81206768.0000

Sentence: the guards of the cardinal, perceiving his youth and that he did not belong to the corps, invited him to retire before they attacked.” “so you may plainly see, tréville,” interrupted the king, “it was they who attacked?” “that is true, sire; there can be no more doubt on that head.
Perplexity: 907044352.0000

Sentence: they called upon him then to retire; but he answered that he was a musketeer at heart, entirely devoted to your majesty, and that therefore he would remain with messieurs the musketeers.” “brave young man!” murmured the king.
Perplexity: 44791756.0000

Perplexity: 65515856.0000

Sentence: it is a brawl; and the proof is that there were five of the cardinal’s guardsmen against my three musketeers and monsieur d’artagnan.” “that is true,” said the king; “but never mind, tréville, come still by the back staircase.” tréville smiled; but as it was indeed something to have prevailed upon this child to rebel against his master, he saluted the king respectfully, and with this agreement, took leave of him.

Sentence: that evening the three musketeers were informed of the honor accorded them.
Perplexity: 304354240.0000

Perplexity: 600448896.0000

Sentence: now, as upon this audience, in his gascon imagination, depended his future life, he saluted aramis and porthos politely, declaring that he would not resume the game until he should be prepared to play with them on more equal terms, and went and took his place near the cord and in the gallery.

Perplexity: 181459744.0000

Perplexity: 123028408.0000

Perplexity: 1489306240.0000

Perplexity: 107820400.0000

Sentence: as, however, he did not fall, as he did not declare himself conquered, but only broke away toward the hôtel of m. de la trémouille, in whose service he had a relative, d’artagnan was ignorant of the seriousness of the last wound his adversary had received, and pressing him warmly, without doubt would soon have completed his work with a third blow, when the noise which arose from the street being heard in the tennis court, two of the friends of the guardsman, who had seen him go out after exchanging some words with d’artagnan, rushed, sword in hand, from the court, and fell upon the conqueror.

Perplexity: 2187976192.0000

Perplexity: 1006827520.0000

Perplexity: 523534112.0000

Perplexity: 63943396.0000

Sentence: in addition to the sword thrust in his arm, which is not dangerous, he has received another right through his lungs, of which the doctor says bad things.” “but has the wounded man retained his senses?” “perfectly.” “does he talk?” “with difficulty, but he can speak.” “well, monsieur, let us go to him.

Perplexity: 262821520.0000

Sentence: he took his army to the priest’s, where they devoured as much provision as would have lasted him for two months, and to the cornet’s, who performed wonders; but as planchet said, “people do not eat at once for all time, even when they eat a good deal.” d’artagnan thus felt himself humiliated in having only procured one meal and a half for his companions—as the breakfast at the priest’s could only be counted as half a repast—in return for the feasts which athos, porthos, and aramis had procured him.
Perplexity: 34972528.0000

Perplexity: 1335996416.0000

Perplexity: 103633904.0000

Perplexity: 79443264.0000

Sentence: “yes,” said aramis, “impart it to us, my dear friend, unless the honor of any lady be hazarded by this confidence; in that case you would do better to keep it to yourself.” “be satisfied,” replied d’artagnan; “the honor of no one will have cause to complain of what i have to tell.” he then related to his friends, word for word, all that had passed between him and his host, and how the man who had abducted the wife of his worthy landlord was the same with whom he had had the difference at the hostelry of the jolly miller.
Perplexity: 218697344.0000

Sentence: “your affair is not bad,” said athos, after having tasted like a connoisseur and indicated by a nod of his head that he thought the wine good; “and one may draw fifty or sixty pistoles from this good man.

Perplexity: 303718080.0000

Perplexity: 801345216.0000

Sentence: “it is not madame bonacieux about whom i am anxious,” cried d’artagnan, “but the queen, whom the king abandons, whom the cardinal persecutes, and who sees the heads of all her friends fall, one after the other.” “why does she love what we hate most in the world, the spaniards and the english?” “spain is her country,” replied d’artagnan; “and it is very natural that she should love the spanish, who are the children of the same soil as herself.
Perplexity: 36055636.0000

Sentence: as to the second reproach, i have heard it said that she does not love the english, but an englishman.” “well, and by my faith,” said athos, “it must be acknowledged that this englishman is worthy of being loved.

Perplexity: 3382539776.0000

Sentence: i was at school at the time, and the adventure appeared to me to be cruel for the king.” “which would not prevent me,” said d’artagnan, “if i knew where the duke of buckingham was, from taking him by the hand and conducting him to the queen, were it only to enrage the cardinal, and if we could find means to play him a sharp turn, i vow that i would voluntarily risk my head in doing it.” “and did the mercer*,” rejoined athos, “tell you, d’artagnan, that the queen thought that buckingham had been brought over by a forged letter?” * haberdasher “she is afraid so.” “wait a minute, then,” said aramis.

Perplexity: 723948288.0000

Sentence: “i like to hear him talk,” said athos; “his dialect amuses me.” “gentlemen,” cried aramis, “listen to this.” “listen to aramis,” said his three friends.

Perplexity: 33405980.0000

Sentence: “well,” cried his auditors; “at the moment you left his house?” aramis appeared to make a strong inward effort, like a man who, in the full relation of a falsehood, finds himself stopped by some unforeseen obstacle; but the eyes of his three companions were fixed upon him, their ears were wide open, and there were no means of retreat.
Perplexity: 337636288.0000

Perplexity: 128974976.0000

Sentence: “a nice acquaintance, my friend!” “porthos,” replied aramis, “i have had the occasion to observe to you more than once that you are very indiscreet; and that is injurious to you among the women.” “gentlemen, gentlemen,” cried d’artagnan, who began to get a glimpse of the result of the adventure, “the thing is serious.

Perplexity: 558400384.0000

Sentence: “the gascon is the devil!” cried athos; “nothing escapes him.” “the fact is,” said porthos, “aramis is of the same height, and something of the shape of the duke; but it nevertheless appears to me that the dress of a musketeer—” “i wore an enormous cloak,” said aramis.
Perplexity: 348720288.0000

Perplexity: 212126064.0000

Sentence: high heads expose themselves from afar, and the cardinal is longsighted.” “well,” said porthos, “in the first place make a bargain with the mercer, and a good bargain.” “that’s useless,” said d’artagnan; “for i believe if he does not pay us, we shall be well enough paid by another party.” at this moment a sudden noise of footsteps was heard upon the stairs; the door was thrown violently open, and the unfortunate mercer rushed into the chamber in which the council was held.

Perplexity: 153702384.0000

Sentence: “come in, gentlemen, come in,” called d’artagnan; “you are here in my apartment, and we are all faithful servants of the king and cardinal.” “then, gentlemen, you will not oppose our executing the orders we have received?” asked one who appeared to be the leader of the party.
Perplexity: 35717848.0000

Perplexity: 3035062784.0000

Perplexity: 205337072.0000

Sentence: what is your name, in your turn, if you please?” “d’artagnan.” “to yours, monsieur.” “and above all others,” cried d’artagnan, as if carried away by his enthusiasm, “to that of the king and the cardinal.” the leader of the posse would perhaps have doubted the sincerity of d’artagnan if the wine had been bad; but the wine was good, and he was convinced.
Perplexity: 152814320.0000

Perplexity: 139551792.0000

Perplexity: 126731760.0000

Perplexity: 421526048.0000

Perplexity: 69093296.0000

Sentence: he then went straight to the door and knocked, murmuring, “i will go myself and be caught in the mousetrap, but woe be to the cats that shall pounce upon such a mouse!” the knocker had scarcely sounded under the hand of the young man before the tumult ceased, steps approached, the door was opened, and d’artagnan, sword in hand, rushed into the rooms of m. bonacieux, the door of which, doubtless acted upon by a spring, closed after him.

Perplexity: 302767776.0000

Sentence: but what could these men, whom i at first took for robbers, want with me, and why is monsieur bonacieux not here?” “madame, those men were more dangerous than any robbers could have been, for they are the agents of the cardinal; and as to your husband, monsieur bonacieux, he is not here because he was yesterday evening conducted to the bastille.” “my husband in the bastille!” cried mme.

Perplexity: 379070560.0000

Sentence: then my dear monsieur bonacieux has not suspected me a single instant?” “so far from it, madame, he was too proud of your prudence, and above all, of your love.” a second smile, almost imperceptible, stole over the rosy lips of the pretty young woman.

Perplexity: 397750816.0000

Sentence: bonacieux looked earnestly at the young man.
Perplexity: 24941878.0000

Sentence: “and if i give you this password,” said she, “would you forget it as soon as you used it?” “by my honor, by the faith of a gentleman!” said d’artagnan, with an accent so truthful that no one could mistake it.

Perplexity: 194316544.0000

Sentence: yes, here it is.” “who is this athos?” “one of my friends.” “but if he should be at home and see me?” “he is not at home, and i will carry away the key, after having placed you in his apartment.” “but if he should return?” “oh, he won’t return; and if he should, he will be told that i have brought a woman with me, and that woman is in his apartment.” “but that will compromise me sadly, you know.” “of what consequence?

Sentence: he expressed to him the fears he entertained with respect to her majesty; he related to him what he had heard of the projects of the cardinal with regard to buckingham, and all with a tranquillity and candor of which m. de tréville was the more the dupe, from having himself, as we have said, observed something fresh between the cardinal, the king, and the queen.

Perplexity: 107329392.0000

Sentence: moreover, d’artagnan had delivered her from the hands of the demons who wished to search and ill treat her; and this important service had established between them one of those sentiments of gratitude which so easily assume a more tender character.

Perplexity: 1937522560.0000

Sentence: without a blush, men made their way in the world by the means of women blushing.
Perplexity: 30636464.0000

Sentence: such as were only beautiful gave their beauty, whence, without doubt, comes the proverb, “the most beautiful girl in the world can only give what she has.” such as were rich gave in addition a part of their money; and a vast number of heroes of that gallant period may be cited who would neither have won their spurs in the first place, nor their battles afterward, without the purse, more or less furnished, which their mistress fastened to the saddle bow.

Sentence: “that is all very well, and enough for today; before we proceed further, someone must be informed that you know the ravisher of your wife.” “but i have not told you that i know him!” cried bonacieux, in despair.

Perplexity: 153849920.0000

Sentence: oh, my god, my god, have pity on me!” without listening the least in the world to the lamentations of m. bonacieux—lamentations to which, besides, they must have been pretty well accustomed—the two guards took the prisoner each by an arm, and led him away, while the commissary wrote a letter in haste and dispatched it by an officer in waiting.
Perplexity: 246851360.0000

Perplexity: 636725184.0000

Sentence: a secret may, by chance, be betrayed by gentlemen; but it is almost always sold by lackeys.” “porthos’s plan appears to me to be impracticable,” said d’artagnan, “inasmuch as i am myself ignorant of what instructions i can give you.

Perplexity: 157188640.0000

Perplexity: 209807936.0000

Sentence: “in that case, in the name of heaven,” continued he, throwing him a pistole, “tell me what you have seen, and i will pledge you the word of a gentleman that not one of your words shall escape from my heart.” the old man read so much truth and so much grief in the face of the young man that he made him a sign to listen, and repeated in a low voice: “it was scarcely nine o’clock when i heard a noise in the street, and was wondering what it could be, when on coming to my door, i found that somebody was endeavoring to open it.

Perplexity: 146848576.0000

Sentence: after shutting the gate behind them, i pretended to return to the house, but i immediately went out a back door, and stealing along in the shade of the hedge, i gained yonder clump of elder, from which i could hear and see everything.

Perplexity: 160251920.0000

Sentence: “but, my good gentleman,” resumed the old man, upon whom this mute despair certainly produced a greater effect than cries and tears would have done, “do not take on so; they did not kill her, and that’s a comfort.” “can you guess,” said d’artagnan, “who was the man who headed this infernal expedition?” “i don’t know him.” “but as you spoke to him you must have seen him.” “oh, it’s a description you want?” “exactly so.” “a tall, dark man, with black mustaches, dark eyes, and the air of a gentleman.” “that’s the man!” cried d’artagnan, “again he, forever he!
Perplexity: 519372736.0000

Sentence: he is my demon, apparently.
Perplexity: 521026720.0000

Perplexity: 2874833664.0000

Perplexity: 85011328.0000

Sentence: at the sixth cabaret, then, as we said, d’artagnan stopped, asked for a bottle of wine of the best quality, and placing himself in the darkest corner of the room, determined thus to wait till daylight; but this time again his hopes were disappointed, and although he listened with all his ears, he heard nothing, amid the oaths, coarse jokes, and abuse which passed between the laborers, servants, and carters who comprised the honorable society of which he formed a part, which could put him upon the least track of her who had been stolen from him.
Perplexity: 23604948.0000

Sentence: he was compelled, then, after having swallowed the contents of his bottle, to pass the time as well as to evade suspicion, to fall into the easiest position in his corner and to sleep, whether well or ill. d’artagnan, be it remembered, was only twenty years old, and at that age sleep has its imprescriptible rights which it imperiously insists upon, even with the saddest hearts.

Perplexity: 301898208.0000

Perplexity: 157283728.0000

Perplexity: 95648104.0000

Perplexity: 150110944.0000

Perplexity: 45325020.0000

Perplexity: 84658424.0000

Sentence: these details will guide her on her part, and on your return, i shall perhaps have some good news to tell you.
Perplexity: 361871776.0000

Sentence: rely on me.” d’artagnan knew that, although a gascon, m. de tréville was not in the habit of making promises, and that when by chance he did promise, he more than kept his word.
Perplexity: 580856192.0000

Sentence: he bowed to him, then, full of gratitude for the past and for the future; and the worthy captain, who on his side felt a lively interest in this young man, so brave and so resolute, pressed his hand kindly, wishing him a pleasant journey.
Perplexity: 97930336.0000

Perplexity: 551018688.0000

Sentence: in fact, in addition to that yellow, sickly paleness which indicates the insinuation of the bile in the blood, and which might, besides, be accidental, d’artagnan remarked something perfidiously significant in the play of the wrinkled features of his countenance.
Perplexity: 1022606656.0000

Sentence: a rogue does not laugh in the same way that an honest man does; a hypocrite does not shed the tears of a man of good faith.
Perplexity: 44383124.0000

Sentence: all falsehood is a mask; and however well made the mask may be, with a little attention we may always succeed in distinguishing it from the true face.
Perplexity: 64585688.0000

Perplexity: 1665515264.0000

Perplexity: 36053228.0000

Sentence: seven o’clock in the morning!
Perplexity: 737066048.0000

Perplexity: 61902820.0000

Sentence: “ah, ah!” said bonacieux, “you are a jocular companion!
Perplexity: 617155200.0000

Sentence: but where the devil were you gadding last night, my young master?
Perplexity: 1423010176.0000

Sentence: it does not appear to be very clean in the crossroads.” d’artagnan glanced down at his boots, all covered with mud; but that same glance fell upon the shoes and stockings of the mercer, and it might have been said they had been dipped in the same mud heap.
Perplexity: 799315072.0000

Sentence: both were stained with splashes of mud of the same appearance.
Perplexity: 564763968.0000

Sentence: then a sudden idea crossed the mind of d’artagnan.
Perplexity: 1062547904.0000

Sentence: that little stout man, short and elderly, that sort of lackey, dressed in dark clothes, treated without ceremony by the men wearing swords who composed the escort, was bonacieux himself.
Perplexity: 1951851136.0000

Sentence: the husband had presided at the abduction of his wife.
Perplexity: 359651968.0000

Perplexity: 122025840.0000

Sentence: no,” said bonacieux, “but yesterday i went to st. mandé to make some inquiries after a servant, as i cannot possibly do without one; and the roads were so bad that i brought back all this mud, which i have not yet had time to remove.” the place named by bonacieux as that which had been the object of his journey was a fresh proof in support of the suspicions d’artagnan had conceived.
Perplexity: 300740128.0000

Sentence: bonacieux had named mandé because mandé was in an exactly opposite direction from st.

Perplexity: 3939269632.0000

Sentence: i am parched with thirst.
Perplexity: 49648564.0000

Perplexity: 758944512.0000

Perplexity: 1337059456.0000

Perplexity: 194991152.0000

Sentence: “good day, dear d’artagnan,” said aramis; “believe me, i am glad to see you.” “so am i delighted to see you,” said d’artagnan, “although i am not yet sure that it is aramis i am speaking to.” “to himself, my friend, to himself!

Perplexity: 98802008.0000

Perplexity: 215042464.0000

Sentence: “i disturb you, perhaps, my dear aramis,” continued d’artagnan, “for by what i see, i am led to believe that you are confessing to these gentlemen.” aramis colored imperceptibly.

Sentence: “you disturb me?
Perplexity: 28096818.0000

Sentence: oh, quite the contrary, dear friend, i swear; and as a proof of what i say, permit me to declare i am rejoiced to see you safe and sound.” “ah, he’ll come round,” thought d’artagnan; “that’s not bad!” “this gentleman, who is my friend, has just escaped from a serious danger,” continued aramis, with unction, pointing to d’artagnan with his hand, and addressing the two ecclesiastics.

Perplexity: 485436384.0000

Sentence: “on the contrary,” replied aramis, “your opinion will be very valuable.
Perplexity: 16414319.0000

Sentence: the question is this: monsieur the principal thinks that my thesis ought to be dogmatic and didactic.” “your thesis!
Perplexity: 811891520.0000

Sentence: are you then making a thesis?” “without doubt,” replied the jesuit.
Perplexity: 286039264.0000

Sentence: “in the examination which precedes ordination, a thesis is always a requisite.” “ordination!” cried d’artagnan, who could not believe what the hostess and bazin had successively told him; and he gazed, half stupefied, upon the three persons before him.
Perplexity: 46314636.0000

Sentence: “now,” continued aramis, taking the same graceful position in his easy chair that he would have assumed in bed, and complacently examining his hand, which was as white and plump as that of a woman, and which he held in the air to cause the blood to descend, “now, as you have heard, d’artagnan, monsieur the principal is desirous that my thesis should be dogmatic, while i, for my part, would rather it should be ideal.
Perplexity: 246838640.0000

Sentence: this is the reason why monsieur the principal has proposed to me the following subject, which has not yet been treated upon, and in which i perceive there is matter for magnificent elaboration—‘_utraque manus in benedicendo clericis inferioribus necessaria est_.’” d’artagnan, whose erudition we are well acquainted with, evinced no more interest on hearing this quotation than he had at that of m. de tréville in allusion to the gifts he pretended that d’artagnan had received from the duke of buckingham.
Perplexity: 1000571200.0000

Sentence: “which means,” resumed aramis, that he might perfectly understand, “‘the two hands are indispensable for priests of the inferior orders, when they bestow the benediction.’” “an admirable subject!” cried the jesuit.
Perplexity: 2129076864.0000

Sentence: “admirable and dogmatic!” repeated the curate, who, about as strong as d’artagnan with respect to latin, carefully watched the jesuit in order to keep step with him, and repeated his words like an echo.
Perplexity: 29651148.0000

Sentence: as to d’artagnan, he remained perfectly insensible to the enthusiasm of the two men in black.
Perplexity: 392611072.0000

Sentence: “yes, admirable!
Perplexity: 102071592.0000

Perplexity: 175856016.0000

Sentence: now, i have confessed to these learned ecclesiastics, and that in all humility, that the duties of mounting guard and the service of the king have caused me to neglect study a little.
Perplexity: 27985838.0000

Sentence: i should find myself, therefore, more at my ease, _facilius natans_, in a subject of my own choice, which would be to these hard theological questions what morals are to metaphysics in philosophy.” d’artagnan began to be tired, and so did the curate.
Perplexity: 194063200.0000

Sentence: “see what an exordium!” cried the jesuit.
Perplexity: 132217992.0000

Sentence: “exordium,” repeated the curate, for the sake of saying something.
Perplexity: 40325904.0000

Sentence: “_quemadmodum inter cœlorum immensitatem_.” aramis cast a glance upon d’artagnan to see what effect all this produced, and found his friend gaping enough to split his jaws.
Perplexity: 235125280.0000

Sentence: “let us speak french, my father,” said he to the jesuit; “monsieur d’artagnan will enjoy our conversation better.” “yes,” replied d’artagnan; “i am fatigued with reading, and all this latin confuses me.” “certainly,” replied the jesuit, a little put out, while the curate, greatly delighted, turned upon d’artagnan a look full of gratitude.
Perplexity: 1502811904.0000

Sentence: “well, let us see what is to be derived from this gloss.
Perplexity: 317641248.0000

Perplexity: 312763232.0000

Sentence: i had chosen this text—tell me, dear d’artagnan, if it is not to your taste—‘_non inutile est desiderium in oblatione_’; that is, ‘a little regret is not unsuitable in an offering to the lord.’” “stop there!” cried the jesuit, “for that thesis touches closely upon heresy.

Perplexity: 458160416.0000

Perplexity: 285534496.0000

Sentence: “here it is,” said aramis, with a little look of diffidence, which, however, was not exempt from a shade of hypocrisy: “vous qui pleurez un passé plein de charmes, et qui trainez des jours infortunés, tous vos malheurs se verront terminés, quand à dieu seul vous offrirez vos larmes, vous qui pleurez!” “you who weep for pleasures fled, while dragging on a life of care, all your woes will melt in air, if to god your tears are shed, you who weep!” d’artagnan and the curate appeared pleased.

Perplexity: 383810432.0000

Sentence: i will see about the continuation of it, and tomorrow i hope you will be satisfied with the corrections i shall have made in consequence of your advice.” “work slowly,” said the curate; “we leave you in an excellent tone of mind.” “yes, the ground is all sown,” said the jesuit, “and we have not to fear that one portion of the seed may have fallen upon stone, another upon the highway, or that the birds of heaven have eaten the rest, _aves cœli comederunt illam_.” “plague stifle you and your latin!” said d’artagnan, who began to feel all his patience exhausted.

Sentence: now, on such a day i can neither eat flesh nor see it eaten.
Perplexity: 218326432.0000

Perplexity: 204802368.0000

Sentence: “i mean spinach,” replied aramis; “but on your account i will add some eggs, and that is a serious infraction of the rule—for eggs are meat, since they engender chickens.” “this feast is not very succulent; but never mind, i will put up with it for the sake of remaining with you.” “i am grateful to you for the sacrifice,” said aramis; “but if your body be not greatly benefited by it, be assured your soul will.” “and so, aramis, you are decidedly going into the church?

Perplexity: 402582912.0000

Sentence: in the first place it had been made by a man quite drunk to one who was half drunk; and yet, in spite of the incertainty which the vapor of three or four bottles of burgundy carries with it to the brain, d’artagnan, when awaking on the following morning, had all the words of athos as present to his memory as if they then fell from his mouth—they had been so impressed upon his mind.
Perplexity: 267178896.0000

Sentence: all this doubt only gave rise to a more lively desire of arriving at a certainty, and he went into his friend’s chamber with a fixed determination of renewing the conversation of the preceding evening; but he found athos quite himself again—that is to say, the most shrewd and impenetrable of men.

Sentence: “my faith,” said d’artagnan, “it appears that i was more drunk than you, since i remember nothing of the kind.” athos did not trust this reply, and he resumed; “you cannot have failed to remark, my dear friend, that everyone has his particular kind of drunkenness, sad or gay.
Perplexity: 36434336.0000

Sentence: my drunkenness is always sad, and when i am thoroughly drunk my mania is to relate all the lugubrious stories which my foolish nurse inculcated into my brain.
Perplexity: 89486552.0000

Sentence: that is my failing—a capital failing, i admit; but with that exception, i am a good drinker.” athos spoke this in so natural a manner that d’artagnan was shaken in his conviction.
Perplexity: 213022128.0000

Sentence: “i remember now; yes, it was about—stop a minute—yes, it was about a woman.” “that’s it,” replied athos, becoming almost livid; “that is my grand story of the fair lady, and when i relate that, i must be very drunk.” “yes, that was it,” said d’artagnan, “the story of a tall, fair lady, with blue eyes.” “yes, who was hanged.” “by her husband, who was a nobleman of your acquaintance,” continued d’artagnan, looking intently at athos.
Perplexity: 186656880.0000

Sentence: “well, you see how a man may compromise himself when he does not know what he says,” replied athos, shrugging his shoulders as if he thought himself an object of pity.
Perplexity: 199777872.0000

Sentence: “i certainly never will get drunk again, d’artagnan; it is too bad a habit.” d’artagnan remained silent; and then changing the conversation all at once, athos said: “by the by, i thank you for the horse you have brought me.” “is it to your mind?” asked d’artagnan.
Perplexity: 725044032.0000

Sentence: “yes; but it is not a horse for hard work.” “you are mistaken; i rode him nearly ten leagues in less than an hour and a half, and he appeared no more distressed than if he had only made the tour of the place st. sulpice.” “ah, you begin to awaken my regret.” “regret?” “yes; i have parted with him.” “how?” “why, here is the simple fact.

Perplexity: 176719808.0000

Perplexity: 250133024.0000

Perplexity: 409205952.0000

Sentence: why the devil!
Perplexity: 302980960.0000

Sentence: a horse is mortal; suppose mine had had the glanders or the farcy?” d’artagnan did not smile.
Perplexity: 138664272.0000

Sentence: “it vexes me greatly,” continued athos, “that you attach so much importance to these animals, for i am not yet at the end of my story.” “what else have you done.” “after having lost my own horse, nine against ten—see how near—i formed an idea of staking yours.” “yes; but you stopped at the idea, i hope?” “no; for i put it in execution that very minute.” “and the consequence?” said d’artagnan, in great anxiety.
Perplexity: 1374071808.0000

Sentence: “i threw, and i lost.” “what, my horse?” “your horse, seven against eight; a point short—you know the proverb.” “athos, you are not in your right senses, i swear.” “my dear lad, that was yesterday, when i was telling you silly stories, it was proper to tell me that, and not this morning.

Perplexity: 189546768.0000

Sentence: you had nothing left?” “oh, yes, my friend; there was still that diamond left which sparkles on your finger, and which i had observed yesterday.” “this diamond!” said d’artagnan, placing his hand eagerly on his ring.
Perplexity: 708367296.0000

Sentence: “and as i am a connoisseur in such things, having had a few of my own once, i estimated it at a thousand pistoles.” “i hope,” said d’artagnan, half dead with fright, “you made no mention of my diamond?” “on the contrary, my dear friend, this diamond became our only resource; with it i might regain our horses and their harnesses, and even money to pay our expenses on the road.” “athos, you make me tremble!” cried d’artagnan.
Perplexity: 529691200.0000

Sentence: “hear the end.
Perplexity: 1639030912.0000

Perplexity: 127643160.0000

Sentence: “patience!” said athos; “i had a plan.
Perplexity: 480072000.0000

Perplexity: 1144014080.0000

Sentence: that’s where we are.
Perplexity: 92850072.0000

Sentence: that was a superb throw, so i left off there.” d’artagnan breathed as if the whole hostelry had been removed from his breast.

Sentence: “then the diamond is safe?” said he, timidly.
Perplexity: 461875360.0000

Sentence: in your place i would stake the furniture against the horse.” “but he will not wish for only one harness.” “stake both, _pardieu!_ i am not selfish, as you are.” “you would do so?” said d’artagnan, undecided, so strongly did the confidence of athos begin to prevail, in spite of himself.
Perplexity: 234623536.0000

Sentence: “on my honor, in one single throw.” “but having lost the horses, i am particularly anxious to preserve the harnesses.” “stake your diamond, then.” “this?

Sentence: d’artagnan threw the dice with a trembling hand, and turned up the number three; his paleness terrified athos, who, however, consented himself with saying, “that’s a sad throw, comrade; you will have the horses fully equipped, monsieur.” the englishman, quite triumphant, did not even give himself the trouble to shake the dice.
Perplexity: 1115217664.0000

Sentence: he threw them on the table without looking at them, so sure was he of victory; d’artagnan turned aside to conceal his ill humor.

Perplexity: 53636736.0000

Perplexity: 120724096.0000

Sentence: “my dear d’artagnan,” said aramis, “don’t be too angry with me, i beg.

Perplexity: 73957512.0000

Perplexity: 332820448.0000

Sentence: i demand the suppression of the thesis.” “since then,” continued aramis, “i have lived very agreeably.

Sentence: porthos, seeing this, retwisted his mustache, elongated his imperial a second time, and began to make signals to a beautiful lady who was near the choir, and who not only was a beautiful lady, but still further, no doubt, a great lady—for she had behind her a negro boy who had brought the cushion on which she knelt, and a female servant who held the emblazoned bag in which was placed the book from which she read the mass.

Sentence: if she had been a great lady she would have fainted; but as she was only a procurator’s wife, she contented herself saying to the musketeer with concentrated fury, “eh, monsieur porthos, you don’t offer me any holy water?” porthos, at the sound of that voice, started like a man awakened from a sleep of a hundred years.

Sentence: where can my eyes have been not to have seen you during the two hours of the sermon?” “i was within two paces of you, monsieur,” replied the procurator’s wife; “but you did not perceive me because you had no eyes but for the pretty lady to whom you just now gave the holy water.” porthos pretended to be confused.
Perplexity: 37592968.0000

Sentence: “ah,” said he, “you have remarked—” “i must have been blind not to have seen.” “yes,” said porthos, “that is a duchess of my acquaintance whom i have great trouble to meet on account of the jealousy of her husband, and who sent me word that she should come today to this poor church, buried in this vile quarter, solely for the sake of seeing me.” “monsieur porthos,” said the procurator’s wife, “will you have the kindness to offer me your arm for five minutes?

Sentence: but that must be a princess, at least—that lady with her negro boy and her maid!” “my god!
Perplexity: 122118744.0000

Sentence: madame, you are deceived,” said porthos; “she is simply a duchess.” “and that running footman who waited at the door, and that carriage with a coachman in grand livery who sat waiting on his seat?” porthos had seen neither the footman nor the carriage, but with the eye of a jealous woman, mme.

Perplexity: 764383616.0000
